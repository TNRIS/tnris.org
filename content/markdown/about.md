We are excited to announce the 88th Texas Legislature passed a bill to officially rename the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) to the Texas Geographic Information Office (TxGIO). The official name change and updates to come will strengthen our ability to support innovation in the use and adoption of geographic information systems and promote the Texas GIS Community as a model and leader nationwide.

<!--Texas Geographic Information Office (TxGIO), formerly known as Texas Resources Natural Information System (TNRIS), was established by the Texas Legislature in 1968 as the Texas Water-Oriented Data Bank. In 1972, after four years of growth and diversification, it was
renamed the Texas Natural Resources Information System.

TxGIO is defined as the following in [Sec. 16.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/WA/htm/WA.16.htm) of the Texas Water Code:
