The Information Services (IS) section maintains the TNRIS digital data library and provides public accessibility to its contents. This accessibility is via the production and maintenance of numerous web applications, tools, utilities, and code packages, which leverage geospatial information for public benefit. Some examples include <a href="https://tnris.org">tnris.org</a>&#39;s <a href="https://data.tnris.org">DataHub</a>, multiple web mapping services, APIs, etc. The IS section is a strong advocate for open source development and the majority of code for their projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/TNRIS/" target="github">Github</a>.

  <p>
    The DataHub is the new modern web application built for the public to view, learn about, download, order, and inquire about TNRIS data. The application simplifies TNRIS data processes and workflows via a content management system which feeds the DataHub frontend. This allows for quicker and more accurate data delivery to the public.

    The Bulk Downloader utility uses the publicly available TNRIS REST API for data.tnris.org collection resources. It allows for bulk downloading an entire collections'
  resources, bypassing the need to click each area polygon (county, quad, qquad, etc) in the download map.

    Texas is no stranger to flood. With its diverse geography and extensive, hurricane-prone coastline, the state frequently leads the nation not only in structural damage but also in loss of lives related to flooding events. This application provides users current flood levels across the state by mapping Flood Gauges, lake water elevations, and weather information. Users can create an account and subscribe to receive SMS text message alerts when gauges reach dangerous flood levels.

    This website is an integral part of the 2017 State Water Plan that lets water users statewide take an up-close look at data in the 2017 State Water Plan and how water needs change over time. The user-friendly website, which is also easily viewed on most mobile devices, now shows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Projected water demands</li>
    <li>Existing water supplies</li>
    <li>Relative severity and projected water needs (potential shortages)</li>
    <li>Water management strategies recommended to address potential shortages</li>
    <li>Recommended capital projects and their sponsors</li>

    </strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    The Geospatial Emergency Management Support System (GEMSS) was developed using the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) managed by the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM). It is the first coordinated effort to create an infrastructure in which data collected during and after major disasters can be integrated with real-time and existing geospatial data.
  </p>
  <p>
    GEMSS allows the data to be presented in a useful and compelling manner, without requiring specialized knowledge of GIS data or applications. GEMSS is designed to become the public domain tool to support emergency activities.
