   The USGS is entering the 2nd year of its 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP) and is accepting proposals for LiDAR acquisitions for Fiscal Year 2016.
---

The USGS is entering the second year of its 3-D Elevation Program [(3DEP)](http://nationalmap.gov/3DEP/) and will be accepting proposals for LiDAR acquisitions for Fiscal Year 2016 beginning in July 2015.

Pre-Proposals submission will be 07/17-08/25 with feedback being provided by 09/11. Submission of proposals will be 09/14-10/23. 

## Texas Coordination Workshop

The USGS is hosting a coordination meeting to increase awareness and to help interested parties prepare for the grant opportunity. The Texas meeting will be held at the [USGS Office](https://goo.gl/maps/xOqL6) in Austin Texas on June 1st from 1:30pm-4:00pm. 

Seating is limited so please [register early](http://goo.gl/forms/xyvQqEWjDG) to ensure seating. 

To view public and federal project areas of interest as well as to submit your own areas of interest please visit https://www.geoplatform.gov/elevation/3DEP

## Quick Look at Proposal Factors:
 - Looking for new LiDAR data for areas without data, where data is older than 8 years  or data does not meet 3DEP QL2 base specs
 - Specifications must be for QL2* quality data(upgrades from QL2 are allowed but upgrade cost from base spec are the responsibility of applicant)
 - Preferred  acquisition project size is 1500-5000 square miles
 - Area of interest overlaps with federal funding partners and satisfies multiple stakeholders.
 - The program is a cost share.  It is a call for funding partnerships and applicants should have cost share budgeted, not proposed.  FY15 cost share average from the 3DEP program  was  an average of 34%  with applicants paying an average of  64% 
 - Technical evaluation of method and means of acquisition. Preference is given to projects that make use of the USGS Geospatial Products and Services contracts (GPSC) Firms.

## Participation
If you have any interest or would like to participate in this program, TNRIS is here to help! TNRIS can offer partnership guidance as well as assistance with the pre-proposal/proposal process. We have substantial experience coordinating and managing regional acquisitions in Texas spanning several agencies/entities at a time through our Strategic Mapping program. We can also offer a competitive, established contract and method of acquisition through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets Contract (HPIDS). The HPIDS contract comprised of pre-qualified vendors with technical experience and expertise. The contract has a proven track record of saving money and time, and can satisfy all technical and specification related evaluation criteria for this program.
