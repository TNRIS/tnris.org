 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) released the third generation of US Topo topographic maps for Texas, complete with TIGER road data. US Topo maps are the modern successor to the original USGS 7.5 – minute quadrangle maps once distributed by print only from 1947 to 1992. The US Topo maps have been produced by the USGS National Geospatial Program since 2012. All 4,442 maps covering the state of Texas are available at no charge from the [USGS Map Locator & Downloader](http://store.usgs.gov/b2c_usgs/usgs/maplocator/(ctype=areaDetails&xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&carea=%24ROOT&layout=6_1_61_48&uiarea=2) or [The National Map website](http://nationalmap.gov/).</p>

> *Excerpt:*
> 
> “The US Topo digital maps are a great public resource to provide authoritative, robust maps to emergency management field personnel and first responders when response time matters”, said Michael Ouimet, Critical Information Systems Manager for the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “Our agency deployed the US Topo digital maps to our field personnel across the state.”
>
> Other important additions to the new US Topo maps for Texas and Oklahoma are the integration of wetlands layers using data from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory, along with the continued incorporation of “crowdsourced” trail data from the International Mountain Bike Association.
>
> The US Topo map improvement program has entered its third, three-year cycle of revising and updating digital US Topo quadrangles. These new US Topo maps replace the second edition US Topo maps and are available for no-cost file download from The National Map, the USGS Map Locator & Downloader website , and several other USGS applications.
