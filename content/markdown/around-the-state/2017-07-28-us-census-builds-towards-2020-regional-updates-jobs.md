<p class="lead">The US Census Bureau recently announced important information for Texas about the 2020 Local Update of Census Addresses.</p>

## Local Update of Census Addresses

On July 14, the US Census Bureau began to mail the Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) Invitation packets to all Highest Elected Officials (HEO). They will continue to mail through the end of the month. Many local GIS officials will receive a courtesy copy of the invitation. Interested individuals should check with their HEO if they do not receive an invitation by August 18th.

More information can be found on the Census Bureauâ€™s website https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography.html. Or call with questions 1-844-344-0169 or email at GEO.2020.LUCA@census.gov.
