AUSTIN – (June 19, 2018) – The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) recently released updates to the [TWDB Flood Viewer](https://map.texasflood.org). The latest features provide an intuitive way for users to visualize areas in the way of a potential flooding and remain informed via text messaging.

The Flood Viewer now supports forecasting elements that are collected from the National Weather Service gages. These gages have the capability to measure the flow of water and forecast flood stages. In addition, anyone who subscribes to those gages through the Flood Viewer can now receive notifications via text when a gage predicts a flood scenario. These updates will give users a quick understanding of what is to be expected in the coming hours or days based on the gage data.

The TNRIS Development Team was tasked with examining the NWS stream gage data and writing new code to identify the gages with predictive ability. Also, they wrote code to identify and show the gages actively forecasting flood stages.

The updated Flood Viewer also incorporates a “Latest Gage Activity” section that displays the latest Twitter feeds for all gages reporting flooding activity in chronological order. When you click on a tweet, a zoomed-in view of that gage will open in a new map.
