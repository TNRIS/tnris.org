Bathymetry of the Texas-Louisiana Continental Shelf was compiled in a project carried out in 2004 - 2006 sponsored by the Texas Sea Grant College Program. The objective of this project was to provide for the first time new bathymetry as good as the available underlying historical U. S. Coast Survey bathymetric survey data. 

The mapped extent was the Texas coastal region, including bays and estuaries, and the Continental Shelf out to the 100-meter isobath. Land topography was added, and bathymetry and land topography were co-registered to a common shoreline, providing seamless across-the-shore map coverage at a uniform contour interval of one meter.
