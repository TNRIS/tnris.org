FEMA compliant Lidar elevation covering Caldwell, Guadalupe, Travis, Williamson counties. Products include Point Cloud, Bare Earth, Intensity imagery, 3D breaklines, and Contour data for the entire area. This Lidar operation was designed to provide a high density set of mass points which are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
