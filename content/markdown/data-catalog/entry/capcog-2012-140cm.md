Using an Leica Light Detection And Ranging (Lidar) system, 206 flight lines of standard density (1.4 meter ground sample distance) data were collected over areas of the City of Austin (approximately 1200 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return.

The data acquisition occurred in 20 missions between January 12, 2012 , and January 28, 2012. During the Lidar campaign, the Sanborn field crew conducted a GPS field survey to establish final coordinates of the ground base stations for final processing of the base-remote GPS solutions.

This Lidar operation was designed to provide a high density set of masspoints within the defined areas. The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
