LAS and bare-earth files of the City of Lubbock and surrounding region. The Lidar was produced by The Sanborn Map Co., Inc. and provided to the City of Lubbock, TX in LAS,ASCII, DGN and Geomedia formats. The orthoimagery is tiled to 1/4 square mile tiles named based on naming convention provided by the City of Lubbock that indicates the City's basemap grid number and geographic quadrant of the grid (NW, NE, SW, SE).

The Lidar is provided to the City of Lubbock, TX and the Lubbock Metropolitan Planning Organization serves as a base map to be used for multiple purposes such as drainage studies, contour development, planning, and map production.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
