A scanned and rectified image of the USGS 1:24k topographic map series to be used in a geographic information system (GIS). A TIFF, TFW, and metadata file exist for each of the 4,400+ topo sheets that cover the state of Texas. The original intent of the dataset was to create digital base map layers from features depicted in the topographic map such as hydrographic, cultural, or road features, that can be used in a GIS.
