The FEMA Digital Q3 Flood Data were developed by scanning the existing Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) hardcopy and capturing a thematic overlay of flood risks. Digital Q3 Flood Data files contain only certain features from the FIRM hardcopy in effect at the time of scanning and do not replace the existing FIRM hardcopy maps. 

The maps displayed on this site should be considered an advisory tool for general hazard awareness, education, and flood plain management. The flood hazard maps displayed on this site are not the legal document to be used when making a single site flood hazard determination.
