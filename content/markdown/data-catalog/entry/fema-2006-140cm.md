This Lidar project is intended to provide high density elevation information of 13 coastal counties of Texas. It includes Bare Earth DEM (vegetation removal) and a high density set of mass points within the defined areas. The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development and for assessing environmental impacts.

Typical uses include FEMA Digital Flood Rate Insurance Map (DFIRM) updates, watershed boundary delineations and other hydro studies per FEMA specifications. County Mapping projects which include several uses such as flood mitigation assessment and mapping projects that include accuracy verification, reporting, and metadata.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
