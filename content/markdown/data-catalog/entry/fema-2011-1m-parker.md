This Lidar dataset represents digital elevation information covering riparian zones in Parker County, TX. The Lidar data was acquired by Fugro EarthData in 2011 using Leica ALS60 Lidar system at a nominal point spacing of 1 meter. The project was funded by FEMA to assist with hydrologic studies and hydraulic analysis to determine the risk of flood hazards.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
