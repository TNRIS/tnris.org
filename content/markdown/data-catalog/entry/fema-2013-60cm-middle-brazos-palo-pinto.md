The primary purpose of this project was to develop a consistent and accurate surface elevation dataset derived from high-accuracy Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) technology for the Middle Brazos-Palo Pinto, TX Lidar Project Area. The Lidar data were processed to a bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM).

Detailed breaklines and bare-earth Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were produced for the project area. Data were formatted according to tiles with each tile covering an area of 1500m by 1500m. A total of 763 tiles were produced for the project encompassing an area of approximately 638 sq. miles.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
