This Lidar dataset is a survey of the Upper Clear Fork Brazos 0.7 Meter LiDAR Survey in central Texas and encompasses 2983 square miles. The LiDAR point cloud was flown at a nominal post spacing of 0.7 meters for unobscured areas. The LiDAR data and derivative products produced are in compliance with the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Guidelines and Base Specifications, Version 1.0. The flight lines were acquired by Digital Aerial Solutions, LLC. between December 12, 2014 and December 24, 2014. Derivative products from the aerial acquisition include: Raw point cloud data in LAS v1.2, classified point cloud data in LAS v1.2, Bare earth surface tiles, LiDAR Intensity Image, Breaklines, control points, project report acquisition report, and FGDC compliant XML metadata.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
