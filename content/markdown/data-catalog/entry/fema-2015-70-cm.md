The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.2 format, 3D breaklines, and 2 m cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation. The Atlantic Group provided high accuracy, calibrated multiple return LiDAR for roughly 932 square miles within the Texas counties of Palo Pinto, Stephens, Hood, Johnson, Erath, Eastland, and Somervell.

The nominal point spacing for this project was no less than 2 points per 1 square meter. RAMPP used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to project specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground, 11-Withheld Points. RAMPP produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 1270 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover the project area.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
