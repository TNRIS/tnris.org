The Geologic Atlas of Texas is a series of 38 hard copy map sheets depicting surface geology for the entire state of Texas at a scale of 1:250,000. The University of Texas - Bureau of Economic Geology began compiling the Atlas in 1961 under the direction of Dr. Virgil E. Barnes.  The effort involved the work of 28 UTBEG geologists, seven cartographers, and several editors, as well as additional geologists from other organizations.  The last hardcopy map sheet in the GAT series was published in 1987.
