The Geologic Atlas of Texas is a series of 38 hard copy map sheets depicting surface geology for the entire state of Texas at a scale of 1:250,000. The University of Texas - Bureau of Economic Geology began compiling the Atlas in 1961 under the direction of Dr. Virgil E. Barnes. Â The effort involved the work of 28 UTBEG geologists, seven cartographers, and several editors, as well as additional geologists from other organizations.

The last hardcopy map sheet in the GAT series was published in 1987.

In October 2002, the United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Texas Natural Resources Information System, embarked on a project to digitize all 38 GAT hardcopy map sheets and compile them into a single, stand-alone Geologic Database of Texas (GDT). Completed in 2007, the project resulted in a rich, digital dataset containing more than 145,000 geologic features in Texas and portions of neighboring states.
