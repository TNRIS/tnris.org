The official boundary of the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP). The area lying generally seaward of the coastal facility designation line, which is the line adopted under the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act of 1991, to describe areas where oil spills are likely to enter tidal waters. The layer also includes wetlands landward of the coastal facility designation line, generally within one mile from the shoreline, along the extreme inland reach of certain tidal rivers and streams.
