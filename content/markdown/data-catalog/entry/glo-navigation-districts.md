Navigation districts in Texas provide for the construction and improvement of waterways to aid navigation, and district commissioners have the authority to go on land in the district and acquire rights-of-way for necessary improvements. The normal district is within a single county, but provision is also made for districts embracing parts of two counties. Some navigation districts, such as the Harris County Navigation District, have more extensive governmental organization. These districts serve populations of at least 100,000 and their administrators oversee the operation and development of deepwater ports. These districts may own and operate docks, warehouses, wharves, grain elevators, and other improvements necessary to deepwater shipping. In 1992 twenty-four navigation districts were registered with the Texas Water Commission.
