The Harris Co, TX Bare Earth Digital Terrain Surface Database consists of x, y, and z point data derived from an Airborne Lidar Topographic Mapping System (ALTMS). The x, y, and z values are stored in ArcInfo Interchange Files. Data was created so that it could be used as highly accurate, inexpensive way to create digital topographic vector and raster files for implementation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and used for the Tropical Storm Allison Recovery Project. The use GRID option when importing into ArcInfo grid. fifteen by fifteen foot cell size.

The data points are nominally spaced at 1.5-meter intervals with approximately a 0.50 meter horizontal accuracy. The 1.5-meter spacing may vary in areas not reflective to laser pulses, such as water bodies, dark asphalt roofs, and some types of glass or fiberglass construction. Surface elevation value accuracy is better than 15 centimeters. Flight altitude is approximately 915 meters, creating a data swath of approximately 550 meters. The elevation data provided is for the bare earth's surface and has vegetation, such as trees and shrubs, as well as the built environment removed from the data set.
