After storms, users document high water marks in and near bayous and tributaries, storm surge high water marks along the coast and the approximate number of structures that were flooded. Most of the information in this dataset comes from the Harris Flood Control District, some other ones from TNRIS research. The information is compiled in shapefile form and relayed to the state of Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and local jurisdictions to aid in the disaster recovery process. This information is useful to check computational models with reality, one example of such benchmarking use is with FEMAâ€™s Hazus-MH runs.
