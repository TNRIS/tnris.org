This Lidar operation was designed to provide a high density set of mass points within the defined areas. The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts.

Typical uses for the data set include: Flood Risk MAP (Mapping, Assessment, and Planning). DFIRM map updates. Watersheds and other hydro studies per FEMA specifications. County Mapping projects which include several uses, in addition to Flood mitigation assessment. Mapping projects that include accuracy verification, reporting and meta data.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
