The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental United States. NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The program was established to support FSA's strategic goals centered on agricultural production.       

This "leaf-on" orthoimagery is used for a wide variety of purposes throughout the state including land use planning, natural resource assessment and policy making . Projects are contracted each year based on available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Since 2008, NAIP statewide imagery have been acquired for Texas on a 2-year cycle.        

Since the NAIP for Texas began in 2004, vendors have used digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing the DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic per county. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.     

Technical Notes for 2016: The DOQQs were compressed by TNRIS into a lossless JPEG2000 format. Per FSA, full coverage along the TX/MX border is not available in some areas and some DOQQ tiles may contain black nodata areas along the TX/MX border.
