The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is a seamless raster product primarily derived from USGS 10- and 30-meter Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). NED data are available from The National Map Viewer as 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters) for the CONUS, and at 1/3 and 1/9 arc-seconds (approximately 10 and 3 meters, respectively) for parts of the United States.

The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is the primary elevation data product of the USGS and serves as the elevation layer of The National Map. The December, 2012 update of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1-, 1/3-and 1/9-arc-second collections were released on December 4, 2012. This marks the 69th update of the1-arc-second layer since bi-monthly revisions began in June, 2000. 

This release incorporates 14,551 square miles of new light detection and ranging (Lidar) data into the NED 1/9-arc-second layer. The NED 1-and 1/3-arc-second layers were updated with 28330 square miles of migrated NED 1/9 source data and 4507 square miles of standard production 10-meter digital elevation models (DEMs).
