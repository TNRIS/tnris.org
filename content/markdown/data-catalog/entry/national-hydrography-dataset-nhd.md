The 1:24,000 National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), jointly developed by the USGS and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is a hydrologic data network designed to show all surface water features including rivers and streams, ponds and lakes, springs, canals, wetlands, and shorelines. 

The NHD dataset allows stream conditions to be modeled enabling the user to predict the downstream impact of a flood event. Also available is a generalized statewide hydrographic dataset which provides unique stream and river identification codes and flow information at the 1:100,000 scale. The NHD dataset can be downloaded directly from the USGS NHD website.
