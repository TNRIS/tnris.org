The Texas-Southwest portion of the NLCD was created as part of a project area encompassing portions of Federal Region VI, including the states of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. 

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. The main objective of this project was to generate a generalized and nationally consistent land cover data layer for the entire conterminous United States. These data can be used as a layer in a geographic information system (GIS) for any number of purposes such assessing wildlife habitat, water quality and pesticide runoff, land use change, etc.
