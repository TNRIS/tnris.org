National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006) is the most recent national land cover product created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. NLCD 2006 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2006. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2006 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2006 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2006 Landsat satellite data.
