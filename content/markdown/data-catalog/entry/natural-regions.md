This dataset was set up as a system to identify broad natural regions of Texas, to serve as a common point of reference for scientists, students, visitors and all citizens of Texas; and to locate and recommend for preservation natural areas that contain unique, significant, unusual and scenic resources, including rare or endangered species and endangered geological formations and ecosystems, with the goal of preserving elements of Texas natural diversity (LBJ School of Public Affairs, 1978 p17).
