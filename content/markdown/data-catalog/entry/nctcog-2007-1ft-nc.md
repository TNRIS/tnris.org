The North Central Texas Council of Governments has facilitated the purchase of digital aerial photography (orthos) for the following eight counties in North Central Texas: Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Kaufman, Navarro, Rockwall and Tarrant. The orthos are six-inch resolution and were collected from January to March of 2005. NCTCOG's contractor for this project is Bohannan Huston. Each TIFF ortho tile is 3,000' x 2,000', or 0.215 square miles.
