The Coastal Texas project area is comprised of approximately 458 square miles. A total of 219 multispectral orthos were created to cover this area. Aerial imagery was collected in panchromatic, Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared which yielded a natural color and false color infrared version of the completed digital orthophotography. Imagery was collected at an approximate altitude of 21000 feet above ground level. These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to enhance the capability of the noaa_2007 Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the USGS. The bounding coordinates provided within the Spatial Domain section represent a rectangle covering the total area in which the project is located. The actual project boundary located within this area is comprised of areas delimited by areas along the coast of the state of Texas. The Coastal Texas project area is comprised of approximately 458 square miles. A total of 219 multispectral orthos were created to cover this area. Aerial imagery was collected in panchromatic, Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared which yielded a natural color and false color infrared version of the completed digital orthophotography. Imagery was collected at an approximate altitude of 21000 feet above ground level. An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.
