An interpretation, by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), of the Original Texas Land Surveys boundaries and bay tracts. The dataset was derived by the RRC, from General Land Office (GLO) Abstracts of Original Land Titles, maps of State-Owned Submerged Lands of the Texas coast (bay tracts), and county maps compiled and drawn by GLO draftsmen, showing the boundaries of the original Texas land grants.

This dataset is a digital interpretation by the RRC of the geographic placement of the original land grants and bay area tracts, and is not a legal survey product.
