Display and/or analyses requiring spatially distributed monthly or annual precipitation for the climatological period 1961-90. Vector and polygon coverages of average monthly and annual precipitation for the climatological period 1961-90. 

Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived raster data is the underlying data set from which the polygons and vectors were created. PRISM is an analytical model that uses point data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to generate gridded estimates of annual, monthly and event-based climatic parameters. Detailed descriptions of the PRISM raster data can be found with the accompanying raster data sets.
