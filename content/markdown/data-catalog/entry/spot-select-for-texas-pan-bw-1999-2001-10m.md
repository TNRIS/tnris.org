The SPOT (Satellites Pour l'Observation de la Terre or Earth-observing Satellites) remote-sensing programme was set up in 1978 by France in partnership with Belgium and Sweden. The SPOT satellites constellation offers acquisition and revisit capacity allowing to acquire imagery from anywhere in the world, every day. 

Each SPOT payload comprises two identical high resolution optical imaging instruments, which can operate simultaneously or individually in either panchromatic (P mode: a single wide band in the visible part of the spectrum) or multispectral mode (XS mode: the green, red, and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum). 

The orientation of each instrument's strip-selection mirror can be remotely steered by the ground stations, offering an oblique viewing capability up to angles of +/- 27 degrees from the satellite's vertical axis. In this way, the temporal resolution is shortened from 26 to 4-5 days for the temperate zones. On SPOT 5 , the HRS (High-Resolution Stereoscopic) imaging instrument also allows simultaneous acquisition of stereo pairs.
