Provide high density Lidar elevation data map to establish an authoritative source for elevation information for the state of Texas. This Lidar operation was designed to provide a high density set of mass points within the defined areas.

The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts. Typical uses for the data set include: Flood Risk MAP (Mapping, Assessment, and Planning). DFIRM map updates. Watersheds and other hydro studies per FEMA specifications. County Mapping projects which include several uses, in addition to Flood mitigation assessment. Mapping projects that include accuracy verification, reporting and metadata.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
