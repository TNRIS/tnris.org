The project area is 433 tiles covering approximately 1750 square miles in portions of Shelby, Sabine, and Newton counties of Texas. The original project AOI was defined by new quarter-quarter-quadrangle, NQQQ, tiles. The outside tiles were buffered by 300m on all sides. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 1.0 meter.

MJ Harden, a GeoEye Company acquired 509 flights lines in 30 lifts from January 12, 2011 through February 13, 2011. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 206 aircraft, utilizing a Optech Gemini sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
