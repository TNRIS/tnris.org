The project area is 802 DOQQQ tiles covering approximately 3241 square miles in the central region of Texas. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisition were from February 4, 2011 to March 5, 2011. A Leica ALS50 phase II+ and a Leica ALS60 Lidar sensor (Gonzales Block) were used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.

Lidar data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. Using a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies, Lidar instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.

The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
