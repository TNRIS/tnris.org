The project area is 802 DOQQQ tiles covering approximately 3241 square miles in the central region of Texas. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisiton were from February 4, 2011 to March 5, 2011. A Leica ALS50 phase II+ and a Leica ALS60 Lidar sensor (Gonzales Block) were used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.

The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
