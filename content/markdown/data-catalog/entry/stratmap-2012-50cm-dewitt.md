Detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures and vegetation. The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for portions of Shelby, Sabine, and Newton counties in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
