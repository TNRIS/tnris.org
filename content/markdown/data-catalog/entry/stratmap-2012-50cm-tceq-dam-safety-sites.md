Topographic mapping of eleven small project sites mapped throughout Central and Eastern Texas in April of 2012. Site A consisted of a total of 40 individual tiles. The product covered by this metadata file consists of classified Lidar point clouds in .LAS format, collected with a Trimble Harrier 68i Lidar sensor by SAM, Inc.

The purpose of this Lidar data is to become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain. The data will also be used by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Dam Safety staff in the performance of hydraulic modeling to determine potential areas of inundation downstream of dam structures for inclusion in Emergency Action Plans and to more accurately assess the downstream hazard rating.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
