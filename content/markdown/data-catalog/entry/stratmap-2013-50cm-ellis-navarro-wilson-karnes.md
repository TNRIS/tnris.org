These AOIs were designated as the Northern and Central AOIs. The Northern AOI covered portions of the following counties in TX: Parker, Hood, Johnson, Ellis, Hill, Navarro, Henderson, McLennan, Limestone, Kaufmann, and Falls. The Central AOI covered portions of the following counties in TX: Guadalupe, Atascosa, Wilson, Gonzales, Karnes, DeWitt, Live Oak, and Bee. The Lidar collected was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the geographic areas covered by the AOIs. The total area encompassed by this project was 4,542 square miles and was supplemented by the collection of a 300m buffer to ensure coverage.

The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract will be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public.

The purpose of this project was to collect and deliver high resolution topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for two areas of interest in TX. The elevation data will be used as base data for various types of modeling and analysis

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
