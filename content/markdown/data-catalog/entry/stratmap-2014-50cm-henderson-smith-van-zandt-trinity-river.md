The purpose of this project is to support the ongoing data collection efforts by the State of Texas to facilitate the mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain. Lidar data was collected for this project, encompassing four distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) within the State of Texas. These AOIs have been designated as AOI 1 through AOI 4. AOI1 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Rains, Wood, Upshur, Van Zandt, Smith, Gregg, Henderson and Cherokee. The AOI 2 is within Dallas County. AOI 3 covers portions of Ellis and Kaufman Counties. The remaining AOI 4 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Navarro, Henderson, Freestone and Anderson. The Lidar was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the areas covered by the AOIs. The data is intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract are to be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public. The project team includes Atkins North America, Inc., Williams Aerial and Mapping (WAM), and McKim; Creed. Fugro Geospatial Inc. conducted an independent QA/QC of the project deliverables for TNRIS. Project stakeholders include the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the City of Tyler (COT), the Trinity River Authority (TRA), and the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD).

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
