The City of Bryan, the City of College Station and Texas A&M Partnered to acquire High quality LiDAR data through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets program. The project area is approximately 286 square miles in Brazos County, Texas. The data was acquired by Dewberry with third party QAQC from Surveying and Mapping, LLC. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition are February 9-10, 2015. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.                      

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
