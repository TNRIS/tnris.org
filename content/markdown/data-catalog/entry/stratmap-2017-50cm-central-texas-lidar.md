The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) partnered to acquire high quality lidar data. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project area is approximately 6,570 square miles in Bastrop, Bexar, Caldwell, Colorado, Comal, Fayette, Guadalupe, Hays, Travis, and Williamson County, Texas. The data were acquired by Fugro with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition were December 15, 2016-March 24, 2017. The purpose of this lidar data project was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled lidar in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools to view and manipulate lidar data. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
