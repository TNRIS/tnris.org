The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and the Trinity River Authority (TRA) partnered to acquire high quality lidar data. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Program of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project area is approximately 1,136 square miles in Chambers, Jefferson, Liberty, and Orange County, Texas. The data was acquired by Sanborn with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter in the Jefferson and Orange block and 8 points per square meter in the Chambers and Liberty block. The dates of acquisition are February 22,2017-March 23, 2017. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).                      

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
