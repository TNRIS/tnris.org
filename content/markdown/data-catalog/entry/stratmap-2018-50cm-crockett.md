The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality partnered to acquire high quality lidar data. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Program of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project area is approximately 484 square miles in Crockett County, Texas. The data was acquired by Sanborn with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisition are March 20,2018-March 22, 2018. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
