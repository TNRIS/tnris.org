The 6-inch and 12 inch orthoimagery of the Capital Area and McLennan County project area was flown during the 2018 leaf-off season in January and February. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). Contributing partners were the Capital Area Coucil of Governments, City of Austin, City of Bee Cave, City of Burnet, City of Cedar Park, City of Lockhart, City of Marble Falls, City of Pflugerville, City of Round Rock, City of Waco, City of West Lake Hills, Hays County, McLennan County, McLennan County 9-1-1.

The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 or ECW and uncompressed GeoTIFF. Flight date is in the image filename as YYYYMMDD. Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.
