The 6-inch orthoimagery covering the City of Georgetown, northern and western Williamson County, and southwest Bell County was flown during the 2015 leaf-off season in early March. The area is part of the 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS.

The City of Georgetown was a contributing partner to BUY-UP or increase pixel resolution for the Georgetown/Williamson County area from 0.5-meter to 6-inch. The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 and uncompressed GeoTIFF.
