The 6-inch orthoimagery covering the San Antonio River, southeastern Wilson County, Karnes County, and Goliad County, TX were flown during the 2015 leaf-off season in late March. The area is part of the 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS. The San Antonio River Authority was a contributing partner to BUY-UP or increase pixel resolution for the San Antonio River area from 0.5-meter to 6-inch.

The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers.
