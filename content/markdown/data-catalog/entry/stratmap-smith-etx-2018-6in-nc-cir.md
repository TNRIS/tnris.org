The 6-inch orthoimagery of the Smith-ETX project area was flown during the 2018 leaf-off season in early January. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). Contributing partners were the East Texas Council of Governments, Smith Co 9-1-1, City of Tyler, Smith County Appraisal District, Smith County, and Texas Eastern 9-1-1.

The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 or ECW and uncompressed GeoTIFF. Flight date is in the image filename as YYYYMMDD. Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.
