This data has been retired and is no longer available for download. It can still be ordered, but only for historic purposes. 

The StratMap transportation layer was an updated, digital version of the transportation features found on the 7.5 minute, 1:24,000 scale USGS quadrangle maps. Where available, digital ortho-photography and GPS data are used to improve positional accuracy. 

Transportation features encompass all public roads in Texas, including city streets, state and federal highways, interstates, and selected private roads. The transportation layer is designed to be a universal transportation layer that can be integrated into a GIS application or project. The StratMap statewide transportation dataset is a publicly available digital data layer which serves as a cartographic product for seamless Basemap production.
