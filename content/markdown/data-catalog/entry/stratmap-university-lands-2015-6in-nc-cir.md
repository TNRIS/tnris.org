The 6-inch orthoimagery covering portions of the following TX counties: Andrews County, Crane County, Crockett County, Loving County, Pecos County, Reagan County, Terrell County, Upton County, Ward County, Winkler County were flown during the 2015 leaf-off season in early March. The area is part of the 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS. The University Lands was a contributing partner to BUY-UP or increase pixel resolution for the West TX area from 0.5-meter to 6-inch. The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers.

Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.

This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.
