This is an ArcView shapefile which delineates the land use and land cover (LULC) of the indicated watershed. Attribution of the polygons is based on a modified Anderson classification schema. A detailed description of this schema can be found in the "Supplemental Information" Section. All LULC data were collected from high-resolution (1:40,000-scale) aerial photography. The minimum mapping unit used for delineating a polygon is 5 acres. Please Note: This dataset has not been ground-truthed for attribute accuracy. See the "attribute accuracy report" below for more information. 
 
 Through a USGS interdivisional agreement between NMD and the Water Resources Division (WRD), NMD has collected the LULC data set for the available watersheds. The WRD Texas District Office intends to use the LULC data to monitor the effects of agricultural pollutants on water quality in the watershed study area.
