This dataset represents the geographic areas identified in TCEQ rules as being subject to regulation under the Edwards Aquifer Protection Program. The coverage was derived from existing official hard copy maps, containing regulatory boundaries based on previous geologic interpretation of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge, Transition, Contributing and Contributing Within the Transition zones, as defined in 30 TAC 213. This dataset contains lines, area features and zone types attributes extended to all 90 USGS 7.5-minute maps under TCEQ rules.
 
 Effective September 1, 2005, amended 30 TAC 213 changes the designation of portions of four areas in northern Hays and southern Travis Counties. The commission adopts changes from transition zone to contributing zone within the transition zone, from transition zone to recharge zone and from recharge zone to transition zone. These changes were made to regulatory zone boundaries on the Oak Hill 7.5 Minute Quadrangle, the Mountain City 7.5 Minute Quadrangle, and the Buda 7.5 Minute Quadrangle.
