Municipal Setting Designations: An MSD is an official state designation given to property within a municipality or its extraterritorial jurisdiction that certifies that designated groundwater at the property is not used as potable water, and is prohibited from future use as potable water because that groundwater is contaminated in excess of the applicable potable-water protective concentration level. The prohibition must be in the form of a city ordinance, or a restrictive covenant that is enforceable by the city and filed in the property records. The program ID is the application number and is the data set's key field labled as "MSD_APPLIC".
 
 The MSD_Boundary data set is a compilation of the real properties boundaries that applicants to the MSD program have designated as 'proposed" MSD areas. This
 data set has been created to show the geograhical area the applicant has applied for an MSD under the program . Each area is identified by the program's application ID (ie. MSD AP 001). This data set corresponds to the MSDs_Point shape file which uses the same application number and key field name "MSD_APPLIC". The point coordinates are the approximate centroid of the proposed MDS area(s). Supplemental_Information: The MSD_Boundary data set has only the MSD program's appication number and the proposed MSD area geometry. The MSDs_Point data set includes only the major program information on each application recived by TCEQ including the status of TCEQ's review and approval of the propsed MSD and the applicants name and the general address of the proposed MSD.
