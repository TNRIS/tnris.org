This layer contains Public Water System Wells & Surface Water Intakes in the State of Texas. The locations for this layer were obtained by the Water Supply Division as recorded from various sources. This layer was built using the best existing location data available from these sources. Although some location errors were found and corrected in the process, some errors still remain. Some locational errors have been identified and provided to the custodian for correction. As resources allow, TCEQ intends to improve the accuracy of these locations to meet the standards set forth in the agency's Positional Data Policy.
