This layer contains all sites in the State of Texas that have been designated as Superfund cleanup sites; it includes both Federal and State sites. Federal Superfund sites have a Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) score of 28.5 or above, and are placed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) National Priorities List (NPL). NPL sites are eligible for cleanup at Federal expense if the responsible parties cannot be identified or no longer exist. Remediation at State Superfund sites must be provided in the following sequence: first, by responsible party funding; second, with the aid of Federal funds; and third, if necessary, with State funds from the Hazardous and Solid Waste Remediation Fee Fund. Sites that were once designated as Superfund sites but have since been removed from the active list are still included in the coverage, but have been given a Status of "deleted".
 
 The TCEQ Superfund Sites layer is used to identify the geographic location of Federal and State Superfund sites within the State of Texas. This data layer can be used for a variety of purposes, including: the plotting of Superfund sites on maps; utilization by field personnel; and performing spatial analysis on how the sites affect their surroundings.
