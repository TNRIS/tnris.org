This layer contains active and historical TCEQ Surface Water Quality Monitoring Stations for the entire state of Texas. The locations for this layer were obtained from TCEQ surface water quality monitoring programs and from other entities including but not limited to: Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), or predecessor agencies Engineering/Environmental firms U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Texas Department of Health (TDH) Councils of Governments Local Governments River Authorities and Utility Districts Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC)
 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Texas Institute of Applied Environmental Research (TIAER) University of Texas Marine Science Institute (UTMSI) Texas A & M University Corpus Christi Center for Coastal Studies (TAMUCC CCS) Underground Water Conservation Districts International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) This layer was built using the best existing location data available from these sources. All location data has been reviewed by the custodian, but some errors may still remain. If data users identify errors, they are encouraged to provide details to the custodian to facilitate correction.
 
 This dataset is intended for general purpose use, to determine locations of current and historical surface water quality monitoring stations as maintained by TCEQ. It is intended for use in planning future monitoring efforts and for reference when requesting surface water quality monitoring data from the TCEQ.
