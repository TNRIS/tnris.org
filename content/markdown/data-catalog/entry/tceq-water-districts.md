The TCEQ has 'continuing right of supervision' over water districts in accordance with the Texas Water Code. As part of the regulatory effort, the Water Districts layer has been developed to provide information about the location, district type and acreage of the districts.
 
 The District layer is used to identify the geographic location of water districts within the state of Texas. This information is used by state and local government agencies, water and sewer utility service purveyors and the public. Information about individual Water Districts can be found within the Water Utility Database at http://www14.tceq.texas.gov/iwud/index.cfm
