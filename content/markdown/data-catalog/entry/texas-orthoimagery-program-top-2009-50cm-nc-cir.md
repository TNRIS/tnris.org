The 0.5-meter 2008/2009 digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs) were collected through a partnership between the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) and the USDA National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). Under NAIP, 213 Texas counties were acquired in 2008 during leaf-on conditions. Under TOP, the remaining 41 East Texas counties were collected during leaf-off conditions in January 2009 to complete statewide coverage.

The January 2009 acquisition also included 18 coastal counties that were previously collected during the leaf-on 2008 acquisition. Through TOP, both 2008 and 2009 acquisitions were made available at 0.5-meter ground sample distance (GSD) as two 3-band datasets (natural color and color infrared). The 0.5-meter orthoimagery are rectified to within 3 - 5 meters or better of true ground, referencing absolute ground control collected for this project as well as ground control assembled for the state archive. The tiling format of the imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 150 meter buffer on all four sides.

The quarter quads are projected to the UTM coordinate system, NAD83 datum. These image data may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. Image products at 1m GSD were processed from the same 2008 and 2009 acquisitions and are available through TNRIS.
