The 0.5-meter orthoimagery covering the entire State of Texas were flown from October 2014 to August 2015. The majority of the moderate to heavy vegetation areas were acquired during leaf-off conditions. The 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) was administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide with select areas additionally flown for 6-inch/1-foot orthoimagery.

The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS. Contributing partners to the statewide 0.5-meter orthoimagery were the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the Texas General Land Office (GLO), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), and the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Partners that increased pixel resolution from 0.5-meter to 6-inch/1-foot in select areas were the University Lands, the San Antonio River Authority, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the City of Georgetown.

All orthoimagery acquired under this project are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each 0.5-meter image tile covers one 4th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quad (DOQQ) or approximately 16 square miles with minimum 150-meter buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 and uncompressed GeoTIFF.
