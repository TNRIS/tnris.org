A LiDAR sensor system incorporating a precision digital aerial mapping camera used during clear weather during low tide conditions. Imagery acquisition for the entire project was completed in a single mobilization. Aerial photography was processed to output orthophotography at a .25’ ground resolution and was delivered in TIF/TFW and ECW/EWW format.
The project horizontal datum was relative to the North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), 2011 adjustment, projected to the Texas State Plane Coordinate System, South Central Zone (4204), The vertical datum will be relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Geoid 2012A.

Aerial imagery was controlled by ground control panels set prior to aerial acquisition SAM provided 2D planimetric and 3D topographic data of the site, approximately 1,678 acres, within open areas not obscured by trees, vegetation, or tall grass. SAM provided 1’ contour mapping of site. Aerial mapping was tested by means of “Ground Truthing” and met American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) standards 1” = 50’ scale mapping with 1’ contours.
