This dataset defines the major bays of the Texas Gulf Coast. The eight major bay systems are Sabine Lake, Galveston, Matagorda, San Antonio, Aransas, Corpus Christi, Upper Laguna Madre and Lower Laguna Madre. Two areas, East Matagorda Bay and Cedar Lakes, are sampled seperately from the previously mentioned eight bay systems. For the purpose of this map, those areas have been included in bays 1 though 8. East Matagorda Bay is part of the Matagorda Bay system and Cedar Lakes is part of the Galveston Bay system.
