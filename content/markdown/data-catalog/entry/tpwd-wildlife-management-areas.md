Statewide polygon boundary data representing Wildlife Management Areas operated by the Wildlife Division of TPWD. WMAs were established to represent habitats and wildlife populations typical of each ecological region of Texas. WMAs were established as sites to perform research on wildlife populations and habitat, conduct education on sound resource management, and to provide public hunting, hiking, camping, bird watching and a host of other outdoor recreational opportunities.
