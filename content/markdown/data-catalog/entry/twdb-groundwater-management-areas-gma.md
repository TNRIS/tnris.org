Groundwater Management Areas were created:
> "in order to provide for the conservation, preservation, protection, recharging, and prevention of waste of the groundwater, and of groundwater reservoirs or their subdivisions, and to control subsidence caused by withdrawal of water from those groundwater reservoirs or their subdivisions, consistent with the objectives of Section 59, Article XVI, Texas Constitution, groundwater management areas may be created..." (Texas Water Code ยง35.001) 

Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 933, ยง2, eff. Sept. 1, 1995. The responsibility for Groundwater Management Area delineation was delegated to the Texas Water Development Board. (Section 35.004, Chapter 35, Title 2, Texas Water Code) The initial Groundwater Management Area delineations were adopted on December 15, 2002, and are modified as necessary according to agency rules.
