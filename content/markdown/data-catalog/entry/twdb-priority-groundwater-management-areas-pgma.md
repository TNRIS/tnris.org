To enable effective management of the state’s groundwater resources in areas where critical
 groundwater problems exist or may exist in the future, the Legislature has authorized the Texas
 Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or Commission), the Texas Water Development
 Board (TWDB), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to study, identify, and
 delineate priority groundwater management areas (PGMAs), and initiate the creation of
 groundwater conservation districts (GCDs or districts) within those areas, if necessary. “Critical
 groundwater problems” are defined as shortages of surface water or groundwater, land
 subsidence resulting from withdrawal of groundwater, or contamination of groundwater.
