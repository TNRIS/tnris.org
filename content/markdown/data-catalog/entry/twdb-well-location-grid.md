To facilitate the location of wells and avoid duplication of well numbers, a statewide well-numbering system has been adopted. It is based on division of the State into a grid of 1-degree quadrangles formed by degrees of latitude and longitude and the repeated division of these quadrangles into smaller ones. 
- Each 1-degree quadrangle is divided into sixty-four 7 1/2-minute quadrangles, each of which is further divided into nine 2 1/2-minute quadrangles. 
- Each 1-degree quadrangle in the State has been assigned an identification number. 
- The 7 1/2-minute quadrangles are numbered consecutively from left to right, beginning in the upper left-hand corner of the 1-degree quadrangle and the 2 1/2-minute quadrangles within each 7 1/2-minute quadrangle are similarly numbered. 
- The first 2 digits of a well number identify the 1-degree quadrangle; the third and fourth digits, the 7 1/2-minute quadrangle; and the fifth digit identifies the 2 1/2-minute quadrangle.
