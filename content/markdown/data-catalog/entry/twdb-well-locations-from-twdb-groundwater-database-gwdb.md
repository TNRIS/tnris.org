The TWDB Groundwater Database (GWDB) contains information on selected water wells, springs, oil/gas tests (that were originally intended to be or were converted to water wells), water levels, and water quality to gain representative information about aquifers in Texas to support water planning from a local to a more regional perspective. 

The purpose of the TWDB's data collection efforts over the years has been to gain representative information about aquifers in the state in order to support water planning from the local to a more regional perspective. Although the nomenclature for a water well identification number, or "state well number," may have promoted the impression that all water wells ever drilled in the state should be assigned such an identification number (and, by extension, reside in the TWDB's database), TWDB employees responsible for the creation of the database did not intend that such a capture of information occur or believe it desirable. The wells in the database represent less than 10 percent of the wells that actually exist in Texas.
