The Submitted Drillers Reports Database (SDRDB) is populated from the online Texas Well Report Submission and Retrieval System which is a cooperative Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) application that registered water-well drillers use to submit their required reports. This system was started 2/5/01 and is optional for the drillers to use.
