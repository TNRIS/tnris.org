The Transportation Planning and Programming (TPP) Division of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) maintains a spatial dataset of roadway polylines for planning and asset inventory purposes, as well as for visualization and general mapping. M values are stored in the lines as DFOs (Distance From Origin), and provide the framework for managing roadway assets using linear referencing. This dataset covers the state of Texas and inludes on-systems routes (those that TxDOT maintains), such as interstate highways, U.S. highways, state highways, and farm and ranch roads, as well as off-system routes, such as county roads and local streets.
