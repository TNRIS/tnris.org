Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) created a GIS-based historic archaeological resource that helps avoid sensitive archaeological and cultural sites and guide field surveys. In an effort to more effectively manage cultural resources affected by highway construction and maintenance, archaeologists and historians in TxDOT's Environmental Affairs Division teamed with PBS&J to create a GIS-based historic archaeological resource. 

The Texas Historic Overlay (THO) would provide important information needed for planning transportation improvements and maintenance projects. The source information for creating the GIS would be historic-era maps. 

Today, the THO is an integral part of TxDOT's efforts to preserve and protect valuable resources, along with almost 80,000 miles of state highways, while securing rights-of-way for highway widening and new alignments for the future.
