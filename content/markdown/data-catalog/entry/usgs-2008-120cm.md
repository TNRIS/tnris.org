This Texas Coastal Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) Task Order is to provide high accuracy bare-earth processed, raw point cloud return data, and gridded Lidar data, for approximately 2388 square miles consisting of the Texas counties of Kleberg and Kennedy.

The project consisted of acquisition, post-processing, and classification of Lidar data. The classified bare-earth data achieves the following: nominal horizontal spacing of 1.2 meters based on the Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 14, related to the North American Datum of 1983 (NSRS2007). Vertical accuracy was to achieve no more than 18.0 centimeters or better relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Accuracy statement is based on the area of moderate to flat terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas in dense vegetation.

The accuracy of the Lidar data as tested met the vertical accuracy of 18.0 centimeters or less standards, however, derived products may be less accurate in areas of dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
