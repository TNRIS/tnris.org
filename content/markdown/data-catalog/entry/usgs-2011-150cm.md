This Lidar dataset is for planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of Lidar data to be collected for Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties, Texas. Lidar data, and derivative products produced in compliance with this task order are part of the data to be obtained under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Contract number G10PC00025.

Specifications listed below are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 13. USGS has a requirement for Lidar data over Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties in Texas. Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties is to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 2.0 meters. The Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties Texas Lidar Acquisition project is to provide high accuracy bare-earth processed Lidar data suitable for the project area.

The project consisted of acquisition, post-processing, classification of Lidar data, and creation of final deliverable products. All areas shall be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 2.0 meters based on UTM14, related to the North American Datum of 1983 (NSRS2007). Vertical accuracy was to achieve a RMSE Z of 12.5 cm (95% confidence level of less than 24.5 cm) or better in the "Open Terrain" land cover category for all areas.

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
