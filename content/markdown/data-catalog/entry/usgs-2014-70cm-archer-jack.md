The primary purpose of this project was to develop a consistent and accurate surface elevation dataset derived from high-accuracy LiDAR technology for Archer and Jack counties in Texas. The project encompasses an area of approximately 1671 sq. miles. The acquisition was conducted from January 4th to March 12th, 2015. The LiDAR data was acquired by Precision Aerial Reconnaissance (PAR) and Dewberry was responsible for LAS classification, all LiDAR products, breakline production, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) production, and quality assurance. The project specification for the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 2 points per square meter. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D hydro breaklines, and 1 meter hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), as well as, 2 and 5 foot contours.                      

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
