This lidar project was conducted to capture the Neches river basin in East Texas. The project area spans approximately 14,235 square miles. The date of the acquisition spanned two years.  Collection in 2016 was flown March 3, 2016 through March 5, 2016. Collection in 2017 was flown January 25, 2017 through February 22, 2017. The LiDAR data was acquired and post-processed by Quantum Sapatial and Dewberry.  The project specification for the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 2 points per square meter and RMSEz of 10cm. This data adheres to the USGS Lidar specification 1.2 for QL2 data. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D hydro breaklines, and 1 meter hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).                      

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
