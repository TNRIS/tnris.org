This LiDAR survey was conducted to capture the 2017 low water event of the Amistad Reservoir, Amistad National Recreation Area in South Val Verde County. The project area spans approximately 89 square miles. The date of the acquisition began on August 14th and concluded on August 17th, 2017. The LiDAR data was acquired and post-processed by Precision Aerial Reconnaissance, LLC. The project specification for the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 2 points per square meter. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D hydro breaklines, and 1 meter hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).                      

Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.
