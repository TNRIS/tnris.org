The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in Texas was developed as a collaborative product by TWDB, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and USGS. The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series. The traditional 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) have been further divided into smaller units called watersheds (10-digit HUCs) and sub-watersheds (12-digit HUCs). The watershed level is typically 40,000 to 250,000 acres, and the sub-watershed level is typically 10,000 to 40,000 acres with some as small as 3,000 acres. Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009. 

This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds. Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.
