TNRIS has many maps and data resources available to the public at no charge from our website that can be incorporated into teacher's lesson plans for all levels. In addition to these resources, we are able to give tours on a limited basis to students and their educators.

## Map Collections

TNRIS has numerous static maps available for download that can be used in digital format or printed out. The majority of maps are part of the Texas Water Development Board's Maps depicting water resources.
