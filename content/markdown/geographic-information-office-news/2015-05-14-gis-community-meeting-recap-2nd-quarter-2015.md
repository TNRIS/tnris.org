A portion of the State Wildlife Grant will be used to acquire scanned Tobin historic orthophoto diapositives from P2 Energy Solutions. The imagery will cover the Blanco River watershed, along with some areas along the lower Brazos and Guadalupe Rivers. Additional areas may be acquired if money and interest are there. Although the imagery will be delivered in digital format, the challenge of georeferencing the imagery remains. The data are copyrighted but TPWD has obtained permission from P2ES to share with other State agencies and State universities as long as they honor the copyright.
