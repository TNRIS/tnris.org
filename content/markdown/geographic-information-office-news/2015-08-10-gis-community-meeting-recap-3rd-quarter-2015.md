OSD maintains an inventory database of state data resources as a service for the Texas Legislative Council (TLC). Information is compiled annually via a survey sent to a specific point of contact, generally state agency legislative liaisons. Since 2013, the survey has included questions to determine if the data collected and published by the state agency contains “geographical indicators” or is available in a GIS ready format.

The next survey is expected to go out in October. OSD requests assistance from the GIS Community to be on the lookout for the survey. The GIO will send an announcement to the Community when the survey is released. The database can serve as an important resource for the exchange of geospatial information.

## TNRIS Project Updates

### Google Imagery Pilot Project Update – Richard Wade

Texas’ size taxed Google’s ability to stand up a dedicated map service using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) technology. The due date for moving to the GCP is 8/7/15.

AppGeo is developing a tool that will generate unique links, both authenticated (password required) and non-authenticated, and allow for better reporting of usage. The new service will now allow users to direct print and export, zoom to level 20 (true 6-inch resolution), and contain new imagery flown in 2015. A shapefile with acquisition dates will be available from the project page.

Information will be posted to the project page as it becomes available.

Special recognition goes out to TxDOT for assisting with imagery review and making calls for Google to correct.

**Read more at the [Google Imagery Pilot Project Page](/texas-imagery-service).**

### 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project  – Gayla Mullins

The acquisition schedule has been affected by the unusually wet spring season and lots of cloud cover. Although a majority of the State has been collected, consideration for collecting the remaining 9% in the next leaf-off period, late 2015, is underway.

Quality control review has begun for Season 1 imagery. All 6-inch buy-up imagery products have been collected and qc is nearly complete. Delivery to partners is expected by end of August.

Upon project completion and delivery, the imagery will be hosted in Esri’s ArcGIS Imagery services.

### 2015 Brazos Orthoimagery – Gayla Mullins

6-inch, 4-band imagery was flown this past winter season and delivered to the Brazos partners. Please contact TNRIS if you are interested in obtaining a copy of the data.

### 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) Update– Joey Thomas

USGS is administering grants through the 3D Elevation Program to update the National Map Elevation Inventory. Grant pre-proposals are due August 25 and there are two entities in the central Texas area that will submit a proposal. If you are interested in applying for a grant, please contact Joey for more information and assistance with writing the pre-proposal as well as the proposal.
