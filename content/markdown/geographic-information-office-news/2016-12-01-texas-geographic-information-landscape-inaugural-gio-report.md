<p class="emphasis">The Texas Water Development Board presents the <strong>Texas Geographic Information Landscape</strong>, the inaugural Texas Geographic Information Officer report.</p>

<p class="emphasis">The primary focus of the report is to outline our accomplishments over the past five years and to call attention to the needs of the state for improved services using geographic information technology. Significant contributions were provided by state agencies with a vested interest in geographic information technologies to perform agency operations and serve the general public. The report will serve as a discussion document for state leadership and as a guide to fulfill the recommendations for each of the needs listed in the report.</p>
