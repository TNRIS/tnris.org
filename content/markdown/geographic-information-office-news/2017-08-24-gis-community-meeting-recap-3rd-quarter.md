### Since we last met...
#### Richard Wade, State Geographic Information Officer

-	The Statewide Parcel Study, a study conducted to understand the availabilty of digital parcel data at the county appraisal district level, was received May 21, 2017.

-	The 2017 GeoRodeo, an annual gathering of geospatial developers, was a great success this year with 200+ attendees. Presentation slides from guest speakers can be found on the <a href="https://tnris.org/georodeo/2017/">2017 GeoRodeo</a> page. 

- The Texas Imagery Service pilot will end on August 31, 2017. A subscription to the service can be purchased through the Department of Information Resources.

-	Registration for the 30th annual <a href="https://tnris.org/texas-gis-forum/2017/">Texas GIS Forum</a> is now open. The agenda is taking shape with a new special format to commemorate 30 years of geospatial education, GIS professional networking, and real-world GIS application sharing. The 2017 GIS Forum will take place October 23-27, 2017.

-	The Texas Water Development Board has released a second version of the <a href="https://map.texasflood.org/#/">Texas Flood Warning</a> application. 

-	Lidar data is now available for download through the <a href="https://tnris.org/news/2017-06-12/tnris-lidar-data-now-available-download/">TNRIS Data Catalog</a>.

-	To facilitate the development of a statewide address database, the Texas Water Development Board is looking for partners to help fund a full-time statewide address coordinator position. Look for posting sometime after Sept 1.

### Lidar for Texas

### Texas Statewide Parcel Study Report

#### Paul Madrid – Sales Executive
Communities are using positionally‐accurate, high‐resolution, street‐level imagery to speed workflows and reduce costs by
minimizing the need for field visits and providing valuable information for Asset location within a city or county infrastructure,
Address verification and Situational Awareness. Public works departments, Utility organizations. Transportation and
Emergency Management departments complete asset data collection projects more quickly and without leaving the office.
The ability to integrate with exiting systems such as Geographic Information Systems and Work Order Management Systems,
makes access simple.

### The <a href="/texas-gis-forum/2017">2017 Texas GIS Forum</a>  will substitute for the 4th quarter Texas GIS Community meeting.
