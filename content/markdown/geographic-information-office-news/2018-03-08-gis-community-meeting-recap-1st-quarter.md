## Project Updates

### Since we last met...
#### Felicia D. Retiz, Deputy Geographic Information Officer

-	The 30th Annual Texas GIS Forum was a well received according to the survey results. Save the date for 2018 - October 22-26, 2018

-	The <a href="https://tnris.org/georodeo/2018/">2018 GeoRodeo</a> is scheduled for May 4, 2018 and will once again be held at the J.J. Pickle Research Center. Call for presentations is open until March 30, 2018.

- The 2018 GIS Education and Training schedule is available on the <a href="https://tnris.org/education/">website</a>.

- The initiatives for a statewide database of address points and land parcels are awaiting the hire of a GIS data coordinator. The goal is to have the position filled by the end of the month. The job posting is still available on the <a href="http://www.twdb.texas.gov/jobs/index.asp">Texas Water Development Board Jobs</a> page.

-	A committee to help identify geospatial data produced at each state agency is forming. The Authoritative Source Committee is co-chaired by Travis Scruggs of TxDOT and Felicia Retiz of TNRIS. The committee is looking for 2-3 volunteer committee members to assist with carrying out the goal of identifying authoritative sources for geospatial data. Once identified and vetted, the committee will work on a plan to catalog the data. If anyone is interested in volunteering, please contact Travis or Felicia.

### Lidar for Texas
#### Gayla Mullins

Close to $600k in grant funds from the USGS 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP) were awarded to two projects in Texas. Acquisition was completed late January and the data are now in the production phase.

Also made possible by 3DEP, Lidar collection is underway along the northern portion of the Texas coast. Coverage will include the following counties:
  - Harris
  - Austin
  - Waller
  - Brazoria
  - Galveston
  portions of:
  - Grimes
  - Walker
  - Montgomery
  - Liberty
  - Chambers
  - Orange
  - Matagorda

  The Lidar availability map is available at the <a href="https://tnris.org/stratmap/elevation-lidar/">TNRIS Lidar</a> page.

### Imagery for Texas
#### Gayla Mullins

Imagery for Smith county is 90% acquired. 2018 marks the 5th time Smith county has partnered with StratMap to obtain 6-inch resolution imagery. The final deliverables are expected Fall 2018.

The Capital Area Council of Government and McLennan County have teamed up with StratMap for the first time to capture imagery over an 11 county region in central Texas. The deliverables will be a mix of 6-inch and 1-foot resolution, 4-band imagery with an expected delivery date of Fall 2018.

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) has announced it will not collect imagery over Texas in 2018. Budget cuts have hindered the bi-annual imagery collection program and 2019 is still in question. Alternatives for statewide imagery are a <a href="https://tnris.org/texas-imagery-service/">Texas Imagery Service</a> subscription or a 2019 Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) statewide acquisition project based on interest.

The Texas Imagery Service is available to Texas public agencies and their contractors through a subscription. Qualifying entities can gain access to the service at any time during the year at a prorated cost for the current period. A subscription follows the state fiscal calendar (September 1 - August 31) and can be canceled at the end of each fiscal year. TNRIS and the Department of Information Resources will host webinars beginning in March to explain the DIR purchase process, the structured cost tiers, and funding options.

#### Claire DeVaughan
Coming soon: 3D Nation Elevation Requirements and Benefits Study, a follow-up to the National Enhanced Elevation Assessment (NEEA) in 2012. NEEA was the basis on which the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) program was formed.  Texas has received funds via several cooperative agreements from 3DEP. USGS and other Federal partners are now in the fourth year of 3DEP providing funds cooperatively for high-resolution elevation data across the nation. The new study will be kicked off in April, in order to better understand user requirements. Last time focused on topographic needs. This time, going to have a bigger focus on bathymetric needs and requirements for inland, offshore and near shore areas, in addition to topographic requirements. The study will be sensor-agnostic (ifsar, single photon, Geiger-mode, etc – doesn’t matter). Richard Wade will be the State Champion with assistance from Joey Thomas of TNRIS. Online questionnaire and maybe interview follow-ups will occur through this summer. Groups to target will be TxDOT, BEG, State EOCs, TCEQ, GLO, TPWD, TDA, Natl. Guard, + regional and local agencies, etc.
