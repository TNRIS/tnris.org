<p class="lead">The 2nd quarter Texas GIS Community meeting of 2018 was held on Tuesday, April 17, 2018.</p>

## Project Updates

<h3><a href="http://tnris.org"><img class="pull-right" src="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tnris_logo.png" alt="logo and link to TNRIS"></a> Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS)</h3>

### Since we last met...
#### Gayla Mullins, StratMap Manager

-	TNRIS has kicked off planning for the <a href="https://tnris.org/texas-gis-forum/2018/">2018 Texas GIS Forum</a> to occur October 22-26, 2018. Please submit your keynote ideas to us.

#### Jason Kleinert, Geo Developer

- The <a href="https://tnris.org/georodeo/2018/">2018 GeoRodeo</a> is fast approaching and will occur on May 4, 2018 at the J.J. Pickle Research Center. All interested should attend this FREE event.

### Lidar for Texas
#### Gayla Mullins

Both the <a href="https://tnris.org/news/2018-04-02/lidar-release-central-texas/">Central Texas</a> and <a href="https://tnris.org/news/2018-04-30/lidar-release-jefferson-liberty-counties/">Jefferson/Liberty Texas</a> lidar projects acquired in 2017 are now publicly available at tnris.org.

The federal projects in Texas from 2017 are still pending release from FEMA.

The <a href="https://tnris.org/stratmap/elevation-lidar/">TNRIS Lidar Status Map</a> has been redesigned with layers to turn on and off to more effectively portray coverage areas of newer lidar over previously acquired lidar.

By 2019 77% of Texas will be covered in publicly available USGS Quality Level 2 or better lidar data.

Just over >$700,000 in grant funds from the 3DEP program were awarded to a coastal lidar acquisition completed this winter 2018 in the Houston/Galveston area. Final data are scheduled to be available to the public winter 2018/2019.
Large federal projects covering much of the rest of the coast as well as the Texas panhandle were also completed for acquisition this winter 2018. These data are scheduled to be available spring 2019.


### Imagery for Texas
#### Gayla Mullins

Imagery for Smith county is 100% acquired. 2018 marks the 5th time Smith county has partnered with StratMap to obtain 6-inch resolution imagery. The final deliverables are expected Fall 2018.

The Capital Area Council of Government and McLennan County have teamed up with StratMap for the first time to capture imagery over an 11-county region in Central Texas. Acquisition is 100% complete. The deliverables will be a mix of 6-inch and 1-foot resolution imagery with an expected delivery date of Fall 2018.

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) has announced it will not collect imagery over Texas in 2018. Budget cuts have hindered the bi-annual imagery collection program and 2019 is still in question. Alternatives for statewide imagery are a <a href="https://tnris.org/texas-imagery-service/">Texas Imagery Service</a> subscription. Qualifying entities can gain access to the service at any time during the year at a prorated cost for the current period. A subscription follows the state fiscal calendar (September 1 - August 31) and can be canceled at the end of each fiscal year.

The <a href="https://tnris.org/texas-imagery-service/">Texas Imagery Service</a> is available to Texas public agencies and their contractors through a subscription. Qualifying entities can gain access to the service at any time during the year at a prorated cost for the current period. A subscription follows the state fiscal calendar (September 1 - August 31) and can be canceled at the end of each fiscal year.


### New Geographic Data Coordinator
#### Ilyanna Kadich

Ilyanna Kadich, who recently joined TNRIS, was introduced as the new Geographic Data Coordinator for the state. She presented a background on the needs, benefits and challenges of developing statewide address points and land parcel information, referencing the <a href="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Geographic-Information-Officer-REPORT-digital.pdf">Inaugural GIO Report</a> and <a href="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/texas-statewide-parcel-data-report-20190802.pdf">Parcel Study Report</a>. She outlined a plan for the first year of coordinated efforts to establish these first-of-a-kind layers through the <a href="https://tnris.org/stratmap/">TNRIS Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Program</a>. These year 1 goals include developing sub-committees, re-collecting coastal county parcels, strategizing a marketing and communication plan, and conducting stakeholder meetings across the state. Updates will soon be available on the <a href="https://tnris.org/stratmap/">StratMap site</a>.

### Big Data, Doesn’t Have to Be a Big Problem
#### Tracie Wilson, National Director, Government Solutions
DMP presented their government solutions for keeping data current when dealing with hundreds of different databases from counties, cities and other
sources.
DMP products and services make it easy to combine data for powerful visualization through application integration. DMP platforms and streaming
solutions can easily integrate multiple data sources into your customized, spatial environment. DMP can maximize your efficiency since we are already
collecting, matching and normalizing data and updating the data regularly. DMP's platforms provide an easy-to use interface to push the right data, to the right people, at the right time. Powerful cloud-based, GIS solutions for non-technical users, with an economical price tag.
DMP looks forward to
collaborating with the State of Texas to learn more about your state’s unique challenges and how we might address them.
