New policy – will now update annually; just finished updating 2016 data, was paused for two years. DUSA (Data Updates Sharing App) for editing roads toward next year’s inventory. All electronic. Not accepting any paper any more. County Judges or appointees make the markups online. Just county roads.

#### County Mapbook
Last hardcover in 2014. Developed an application instead for emergency use due to post-Harvey. County grid PDFs. Print On Demand.

Crowdsourcing Efforts (within TxDOT) for ROW, Guardrail, Cemeteries – Digitize what you can see on imagery for estimates.

#### Open Data Portal Upgrade
About to launch, will look a lot different per new Esri template.

#### GIS Work Group
- New for TxDOT-wide governance. Providing GIS leadership and stakeholder voice. Short term goals: GIS Data Inventory and Metadata Standard
- Project Tracker Upgrade – new frontend
- Asked group about GitHub Training interest.
- Annual GIS Conference at TxDOT, combined with Survey Conference.
- Statewide Planning Map redesign to new Javascript 4X API.

**Aja asked** - How often is city polygon’s layer updated? Super infrequently. Leaving in current state now until roadways can change.

**Claire asked** – Cemeteries available to public? Yes, in open data portal eventually.
