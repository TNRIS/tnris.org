## Welcome and Introductions

Richard Wade opened the meeting with introductions around the room and on the phone.

**Contract Update:** Reviewed and waiting for response from Google.  It will be sent to this group. Contact DIR for any additional questions.


## 2015 Google Imagery Status

**Gayla Mullins presented the 2015 Google Imagery Status update.**

 - Looked at 12-13 blocks closely
 - 3 reviewers from TNRIS, 3 reviewers from TxDOT. 
 - Asked Google to respond to major issues e.g. wavy bridges and sun flared buildings
 - Some responses include that this is what it in google maps and this is what it will be
 - Greatest concern is the Houston block. Google recognized Houston as a block that will be reprocessed in full. Options for other blocks are reject the blocks or patch the block (TNRIS did not advise this as it would lead to inauthentic data with inconsistencies of the year within the block).
 - Dallas Block: more anomalies more built up features which will require additional processing. More detailed explanation from Google for Dallas, but not planning to reprocess Dallas. 
 - TNRIS informed Google that there needs to be a better process to improve going forward and to correct. It passes our QC is not a legitimate response.
 - GIS SG would like to have some way to quantify the quality of the data and improvement year to year. One way to do this is to look at the images identified in one year to see if it is corrected the next year.
 - There is an awareness that 2015 imagery review is a learning opportunity to prepare for the 2016 data. 
 - GIS SG needs a report card of data quality that can be quantified and compared year to year.
 - ACTION ITEM: TNRIS to identify errors and spot check corrections.
 - In general, DPS, TxDOT, TCEQ, CSEC interested in having newer imagery on a fast-track basis rather than QC closely before and delay. However, there needs to be a way to get credits for any defective imagery identified after being loaded. 
 - Two levels of review where it is made available for a general review by TNRIS, it wouldn’t take a month to review six blocks, purchased on that preliminary review.  
 - GIS SG in favor of Gayla Mullin’s proposal to have a TNRIS high level review in the shortest amount of time (less than a week is ideal) before loading as purchased.  And, go back and look at known problem areas to see if they are corrected.
 - Current invoicing process is that  as it is accepted then invoice is cut.

## 2016 Google Imagery/AppGeo Updates

**Kara Manton provided the 2016 Goolgle Imagery/AppGeo update.**

- More open information about flights resulted in a shared sheet that will soon be available to show status of flight from flights scheduled to having imagery loaded into the system. Status of all flights. Date of acquisition, Google process and QC steps, imagery provided for review, TNRIS QC status.
- Issue tracking worksheet for blocks under review will reside as a tab in Status sheet.
- This spreadsheet intended to be a high level overview and will be shared with GIS SG members.
- Spreadsheet has only been in place for a week. Suggested improvements are welcome.
- 2016 flights are all in varying stages of processing and quality check. They have all been flown. 
- “X” is an indicator of a rejected flight, not high enough quality to sell, as deemed by Google.
- TNRIS can share the spread-sheet to people who supply a gmail address. UPDATE: Gmail address is not required. A link will be sent to members.

## WMTS Fix for HTML Web App 

**Chris Bardash presented on WMTS for ESRI javascript API.  A.J. with NTT assisted in resolving the issue.**

- Java solution using a proxy document that gets loaded with HTML.
- Proxy document can be downloaded from ESRI.
- In order to use proxy it needs to be on the same server as the application.
- Provided links and code snippits for ESRI fix for HTML web app.
- The fix resulted in expected load times.
- Presentation will be cleaned-up and posted to the Google Imagery Pilot Project page.

## GIO Report Interview Updates

**Richard Wade and Felicia Retiz**

- Agency meetings are ongoing; Meeting set with Texas Legislative Council and the Texas Department of Insurance
- A digital survey is being created to get input from agencies that could not meet in person and for select local and regional governments.
- Draft will be submitted to GIS SG for review by April 15.
- Initial draft by next meeting followed by revised drafts every 6 weeks or so until final report is presented in the fall.

## Discussion Items

- Richard Wade has been discussing with DIR the means to spending of any excess funds from GIS. This seems possible, but issues are being worked.
- Very possible to have overages as more entities join or images are not purchased.
- GIS SG needs to formulate a way of making recommendations to BELC or decisions regarding overage spending.  Richard Wade and Brooks Myers will discuss and determine a recommendation.
- Felicia Retiz has developed a web-site off of the GIO page for the posting of meeting agendas, minutes, and other information related to the GIS SG.
- A.J. offered to receive e-mails to help with anyone who has issues with the WMTS fix

## Next Meeting: April 19, 2016, 1:30 p.m. – 3:00 p.m.
