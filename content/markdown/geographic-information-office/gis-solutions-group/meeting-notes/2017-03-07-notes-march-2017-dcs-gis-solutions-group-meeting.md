## Welcome and Introductions - Richard Wade


## Google Imagery Service and AppGeo Appliance Updates - Kara Manton

Kara from AppGeo reviewed the recent activity in the Google Imagery Portal – Longview and LaGrange.  Discussion was had about the differences between Public and State Imagery since they are not the same – updates can be delayed and the State Imagery does not include oblique imagery.

Kara will create a training document for using Giza and TNRIS will create a user webinar for new users.

Imagery downloads are not included in the service but TNRIS can provide this.


## Parcel Data Study Update - Jennifer Sylvester

Parcel Study report draft v.1 was submitted for review 3 weeks ago to the volunteer committees with edits and comments returned EOB Monday, March 6. The report is well-shaped and near final recommendations. The next steps are to begin discussing a pilot project (along the coast) to determine amount of work it will take to assemble parcel data from individual county appraisal districts. Ed Kelly asks how the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) is using the information and how does it compare to other insurance governing agencies. TDI responded to a state survey regarding the use of a statewide parcel. TDI reported the ability to use the parcel database to verify an address location would assist with more accurate maps such as fire incidents and fraud investigations.
Several recommendations were suggested for improvement:
- Include state agency spending for parcel data
- Contact surveyor community to request feedback and get their perspective
- Create a one-page summary as a quick view and discussion document
- Include the percentage of appraisal districts currently using 3rd party for parcel data management
- Research standards and minimum set of attributes for database
- Include GLO pilot information in recommendation

## Enterprise GIS Discussion - Richard Wade

TNRIS has been working with DIR on a business case for a share service and how charges would work for the various tiers and participants for shared GIS imagery.

TNRIS has surveyed agencies on what additional shared services they are interested in having in the enterprise GIS. Access to historical imagery is requested by TCEQ.

Chris Bardash wants a means to share existing services that their agencies are offering without having to move the data into a single repository. TxDOT is currently serving 40+ layers in ArcGIS Online.

TNRIS wants other agencies to share their information through the enterprise GIS no matter where the data reside. In addition, we want the information from the entities funding the shared service effort.

It is a pay to participate situation. TNRIS will need to require that agencies contribute funds to access data in the program in a convenient format and with ease of access.  The enterprise would offer premium services to those who pay.  

Sue at CSEC – thinks receipt of discrepancy reports must go to agencies that control the data to help with data correction and referral to the right entity.  She would also want to track how responsive the entity is. 
State of Maine Research – CSEC spoke with GIS officials regarding their enterprise.
Every state agency voluntarily contributes to the enterprise database.  Those agencies requesting confidential data are required to pay a premium fee for access.
If you contribute data, you get to pull data out. If you don’t contribute data, that agency must pay more for the data.  This model incentives agencies to participate.  The funding model that says I get everything if I contribute to the repository.

Q. Is the idea to have a larger collection of authoritative and hosted data set.
Key objective is to figure out how to get people to participate and what the value add is.  The raw form data would still be available, but less convenient due to local drive download as opposed to an online streaming service of the latest data.

Idea is to use imagery as the draw but include enterprise shared data sets as part of the whole solution.

CSEC aggregating data from COG and COG aggregating data from the county. There needs to be a means to report and correct discrepancies in communication with the data owner and source.

Currently we have just enough to cover FY2018 for Google Imagery.
