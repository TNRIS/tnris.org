## Welcome and Introductions - Richard Wade

Richard opened the meeting with a discussion about meeting ground rules and circulated a document that provided some guidelines.  It is important that this group drives GIS forward for the State.

The GIS Solution Group Charter is available on the TNRIS website (insert link) and this needs to be reviewed and updated regularly.  Some items to be reviewed is who attends that meetings and the type of decision making the group uses.


## Google Imagery Service and AppGeo Appliance Updates - Kara Manton

Kara from AppGeo reviewed the recent activity in the Google Imagery Portal – Longview and LaGrange.  Discussion was had about the differences between Public and State Imagery since they are not the same – updates can be delayed and the State Imagery does not include oblique imagery.

Kara will create a training document for using Giza and TNRIS will create a user webinar for new users.

Imagery downloads are not included in the service but TNRIS can provide this.


## Texas Imagery Service Subscription Fees - Gayla Mullins/Felicia Retiz

Gayla and Felicia reviewed the pricing tiers by entity type and usage levels.  The data is from the period of 2/1/17 – 4/30/17 and was then converted to an annual usage value.  DIR sent LAR packages to state agencies on the first tab of the spreadsheet and agencies at the bottom of the page replied that they would not be using the Google Imagery after FY17.  

Questions were raised about locking in the price for two years and other ways to use the money from entities or increase the offering.

## Parcel Pilot and Participation - Group Discussion

TNRIS had a meeting related to Parcel Studies and would like to work with County Appraisal Districts to use this data with Google Imagery to increase users.

Parcel Report will be released on 5/19/17. 

TNRIS and GLO working together on the pilot. Participats will be solicited input in late May or early June. The AOI for the study will be along the coast.

Ed Kelly is working on a data sharing compact for all state agencies as well as an Authoritative Data List.
