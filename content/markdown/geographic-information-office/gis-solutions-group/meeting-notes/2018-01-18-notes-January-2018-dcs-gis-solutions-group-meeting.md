## Welcome and Introductions

## Charter Review and Discussion - Ed Kelly
Last meeting discussion was held around expanding GIS SG. Ed and Felicia have added language to support multiple tiers: Full Members, Associate Members and Partner Members
 o	Full Members are the State Agencies that actively contribute to the GIS SG discussions, and lead the decision-making process.
 o	Associate Members are local/regional/private entities that purchase GIS Services, and are entitled to attend GIS SG Meetings, but do not contribute actively or take part in the decision making process.
 o	Partner Members are those that will be selected to represent groups of entities that receive GIS services (some may be Associate Members) in GIS SG discussions. They will actively contribute, but will not take part in the decision making process.
 
Further discussion and definition needed to make this tiered system successful. EG: How are State Agencies that contribute to the program but are not currently purchasing services categorized? How will counties/regions with mixed levels of contribution/consumption select representation? Will GIS SG support logistics for subcommittees formed by partner groups to discuss issues under GIs SG scope? How will onboarding happen, and will representatives be rotated?

Voting members agreed to form subcommittee to explore process of expansion and define control measures to avoid scope-creep and maintain group efficacy.

## Texas Imagery Participation Update
•	Dallas, Ft. Worth, Houston, Loveland have been onboarded. Pursuing Reeves County and others
•	All non-contributing agencies have been off-boarded, some exceptions made in consideration of Harvey contributions
•	Current Multi-Regoinal Bucket (top tier model) GCS Storage costs as of 10/17 are $5,871/mo or $70,217/yr
•	Nearline and Coldline Storage solutions are being evaluated.
 o	Performance is nearly identical. Primary difference is that images must be stored for set amount of time (30 days for Nearline, 90 days for coldline), rather than on-demand as with current model. No change to image accessibility, only storage location.
 o	Coldline is considered “deep-storage” option, and is lower cost, but had better observed performance than Nearline
 o	Conversion costs higher than anticipated, but If 50% of current storage volume is converted to coldline, annual savings will be $25,700
 o	Further testing and cost-modeling is ongoing
•	Viewing will still take place on top API layer, images will be moved to deep-storage after 3 years to realize savings without impacting availability/performance.
•	Further details needed regarding cost and effort of moving images from deep storage back to top layer if needed
•	All details will be shared with GIS SG members as needed for independent investigation/assessment


## Authoritative Sub-Committee Plans - Travis Scruggs, Felicia Retiz
•	Travis has agreed to be co-chair with Felicia for subcommittee
•	Initial goal is to identify agencies who are not current contributors, who can collect/organize/publish/share info critical to Geographical Information Office’s mission.
 o	“Tasked by statute TWC 16.021(c)(2) to establish, support, and disseminate authoritative statewide geographical datasets”
•	GIS SG members are asked to submit agency or individual recommendations to serve on the subcommittee asap.
•	Basic outline of governing document already in works. Attachment A
•	GIS Geospatial surveys should provide baseline of existing datasets to be leveraged


## General Discussion Topics
•	Next meeting – Tuesday, February 13 2:30 – 4:00 p.m
