## Welcome and Introductions

## Membership Roles/Responsibilities - Group Discussion
Subcommittee met last week regarding refinement of GIS membership process and charter language
    o   Maximum of 12  (7 core, 5 regional/local) members, any overage has to be approved by committee
    o   All members must contribute, does not have to be financial
    o   Membership ends with fiscal year, new members chosen by committee at start of each fiscal year
    o   Members may return each year, depending on contribution
Group discussed need to preserve transparency and involvement of local and educational entities, while maintaining authority of 7 core committee members
    o   Brooks suggested titling non-core members “ex-officio” members, and having subcommittee discuss and create language detailing specific intent and scope of “ex-officio” members
    o   Group agreed, Brooks with action to frame and deliver official request to subcommittee

## Texas Imagery Participation Update - Gayla Mullins
Google provided notification of current/upcoming quality issues
    o   “Thin Line” issue: Thin lines have so far appeared every 100 yards in 8 blocks flown from 8/17 to January 2018
    o   Quality control process is ongoing, more blocks flown during this period may present issue, Google will notify if found
    o   “Thin Line” issue will persist until next fly-over of affected areas
Gayla expressed concern around consistency and currency of data
    o   Some blocks flown twice in same year, some not flown at all 
    o   Some blocks not refreshed since 2014, asked Google to prioritize these
Group discussed currency requirements 
    o   Entire state must be refreshed at least every 3 years
    o   Concurred with need for priority on blocks last flown in 2014
    o   Suggested using older (within 3 years) images rather than newer, quality-reduced images until next fly-over
    o   Stated as long as spatial accuracy is not affected, newer is better
    o   Concluded newer images will be used, with access to older on request
(Unknown) requested Brownsville be given extra priority due to ongoing project
New customers continuing to sign up about 1/mo, most recently UT


## Google Cloud Platform Storage - Jenn Sylvester
Continuing investigation indicates any hybrid solution will incur additional cost, suggestion is to choose one storage line per layer
Based on historical usage data, Statewide layer is a prime candidate for conversion to cold-storage
    o   This comprises the bulk of current storage, ~24TB, and will produce the greatest immediate savings
    o   Conversion will take ~3 days, existing layer will be available until completion
    o   Approval given to proceed with conversion, contingent on successful test run
Discussion opened regarding serving LIDAR rather than storing as image layer, tabled until later date.
