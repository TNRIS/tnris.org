## Welcome and Introductions

## 3D Building Extraction Project Presentation - Miguel Pavon
Miguel presented the process for creating 3D buildings from classified Lidar.
    o   Though the state is 70% covered by Lidar, more than half of the Lidar datasets are classified only to ground and other. Building classification is needed for the first step in the process.
    o   Some benefits of having 3D building data include visuals for weather disasters, flood modeling, emergency response, etc.

## Spending Plan Discussion - Group Discussion
DIR has requested a plan on how we will spend the carry over savings. Savings were realized when additional participants joined the Texas Imagery Program
    o   Google offered training at ~$19k per class (2 offered)
    o   ~$60k left in budget. Parcels may be priority for savings.
    o   •   Group discussed other opportunities that may be a priority to carry over spending such as classification of FEMA Lidar. The remaining budget won’t likely cover enough to make a difference.

## Topics for GIS SG Consideration - Group Discussion
•	Next meeting – Tuesday, August 14, 2:30 – 4:00 p.m
