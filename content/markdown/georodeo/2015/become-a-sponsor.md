The GeoRodeo is a gathering of some of Texas's most forward-thinking Geospatial developers and other professionals seeking to incorporate new techniques and ideas into their work.

We’re asking for your support to improve and upgrade the event for the Texas Geospatial community. 

By becoming a sponsor, you will help us bring speakers from across the country and feed hungry code wranglers. 

For a **$500 contribution**, you'll receive:
- Recognition on the GeoRodeo website,
- Acknowledgements during the event,
- Distribution of your organization’s literature or information.

Thanks for supporting the GeoRodeo!
