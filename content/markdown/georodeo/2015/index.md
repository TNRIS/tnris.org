<h4><img class="img-circle pull-right presenter" src="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sean_gillies.jpg">Writing, running, and Distributing Python GIS Software</h4>

Many of us are using Python to extend our GIS software or write entirely new applications. I'm going to provide an overview of modern best practices for writing, running, and distributing Python GIS software, talk about new features of Python 3, and demonstrate several new modules that will help you make the most out of Python.

<h4><img class="img-circle pull-right presenter" src="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dana_bauer.jpg">Death and Open Data: Conquering your Fears and Sharing your Data</h4>
 
People in many types of organizations are often afraid to share their data; we fear losing control, and we fear the unknown. Drawing from strategies used by counselors who tackle end-of-life conversations (death is the biggest fear of all), I'll talk about the cultural changes necessary for our community to get data out in the open.

<h4><img class="img-circle pull-right presenter" src="https://tnris-org-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/andrew_thornton.jpg" alt="Headshot of Andrew Thornton">Web Maps with D3.js</h4>

These days, the common thread among many web maps is very likely a JavaScript library called [D3.js](http://d3js.org). D3 is quickly becoming the de facto choice when it comes to data visualization in the browser. It provides incredible flexibility by embracing web standards, resulting in few limitations other than a developer's imagination. In this talk, Andy will take the intimidation out of this little powerhouse of a library, and show you the essentials you need to begin making your own incredible maps with D3.
