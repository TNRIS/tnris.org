#### About Todd

Recognizing the possibilities behind the mechanics of Xbox and PlayStation, Todd rethought the standard for traditional data analytics. Replacing his CPU for a GPU, he was one of the first to discover the untapped potential of GPUs to analyze, visualize and explore data in ways never done. Now? He reduces query times from hours to milliseconds for Verizon, Amazon and Simulmedia, enabling them to spend significantly less time crunching data and more time analyzing to make key business decisions.

The Bike-Ped Map functions as both a geographic resource and a public engagement tool. Users can find existing bike lanes, trails, sidewalks, etc, as well as planned projects. Three publicly-editable layers allow people to suggest new projects or highlight gaps in the data. The Project App shows scoring and funding information for KTMPO projects listed in the MTP. I will discuss the challenges involved in configuring our local server and using the tools on ArcGIS Online to develop these apps.
