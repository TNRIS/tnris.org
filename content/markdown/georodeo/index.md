### Lightning Talks

As we've done in previous years, we'll end the day with **Lightning Talks**, where any attendee can step up to present. If you have something quick to share, come prepared with an idea of what you could present within a short 5-minute time slot and sign up for a lightning talk on-site at the event.

**Lightning Talk Rules**
- 5 minutes max – We will tightly enforce this.
- No external computer laptops or tablets - only browser based access to materials and links.
- Tips: Understand your topic – make your point at the beginning. You don't have to use all 5 minutes.
