The latest satellite in the Landsat constellation was launched earlier this year on February 11, 2013. After a series of orbital checks and calibration procedures, NASA transferred operations to the USGS on May 30, 2013.

[Landsat 8](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat), known as [LDCM](http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov/) before May 30, continues the legacy of global earth observation that began 40 years ago with the launch of the first Landsat satellite. Landsat image data are critical for energy and water management, forest monitoring, human and environmental health, urban planning, disaster recovery and agriculture.

Download Landsat 8 imagery **free of charge** from [USGS EarthExplorer](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), [LandsatLook](http://landsatlook.usgs.gov/) or [GloVis](http://glovis.usgs.gov/).

Landsat 8 is a joint venture between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The new [Operational Land Imager (OLI)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/spacecraft/index.html) onboard Landsat 8 captures **two new spectral bands** to:
1. Observe coastal zone characteristics and
2. Detect cirrus clouds.

Also on Landsat 8, the new [Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/spacecraft/index.html) detects land surface temperature in two new narrow thermal bands. Additionally, refinements were made to the remaining Landsat heritage bands and a new Quality Assessment band is included in the available data files. Landsat 8 captures image data with a “pushbroom” design along a 185-km wide swath. The new satellite has a 38% increase in the number of scenes captured per day compared to Landsat 7.

Compare common <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat">band combinations</a> between Landsat 8 and Landsat 5/7.

Scene footprints that cover Texas are shown in the map. Every scene, or path/row designation, is imaged **every 16 days** by Landsat 8. Image products are available **within 12 hours** of data reception.
