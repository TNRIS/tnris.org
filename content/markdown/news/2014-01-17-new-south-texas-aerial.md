[Surdex Corp.](http://www.surdex.com) was selected under the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) State contract as the data provider. The TNRIS Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) administered the project providing coordination and project management services. TNRIS also performed data QC of the interim and final orthoimage products.

The orthoimagery are used for city planning, road construction projects, utilities mapping, emergency response, 911 addressing, hydrography, transportation planning, among many other applications.

The orthoimagery were acquired between December 2012 and February 2013 during leaf-off conditions. Leaf-off imagery allows the user to see more on-the-ground features underneath deciduous tree cover. Also, it is much easier to distinguish deciduous vs. evergreen vegetation with imagery acquired during the leaf-off period.
