## What are we Looking At?
</p>This is an aerial photo taken in 1938 of downtown San Antonio, and is part of the Bexar County 1938 Historical Imagery aerial photos.</p>

Interesting details include the absence of San Antonio's major highway system that form major boundaries around the downtown today. This would have been the year just prior to development of the River Walk with funding from the Works Project Administration (WPA), and the start of shaping it into the major recreational and tourist attraction it is today.

The Alamo complex is found in the middle right portion of the image.
