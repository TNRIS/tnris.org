TNRIS received a grant as part of the Coastal Impact Assistance Program(CIAP) from GLO in 2010. The CIAP imagery project at TNRIS covered Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Matagorda, Orange, San Patricio and Victoria County for several decades within our collection.  Over 5,000 frames were scanned and referenced as part of the project using ERDAS Autosync.  Seamless mosaics were also generated for each imagery dataset using ERDAS Mosaic Pro.

Images were scanned at 800 dpi to create a 1 meter resolution dataset. ERDAS AutoSync was used to reference the historical imagery to the TOP 1995/1996 Orthoimagery dataset.   The CIAP imagery is the most accurate historical imagery product that TNRIS has produced.  The details on each frameâ€™s accuracy and statistics are included in metadata for each frame.

Mosaics were created in the Mosaic Pro toolset of ERDAS.  The mosaics are black and white, 1 meter resolution datasets of each of the collections.  Referenced images were edgematched prior to mosaicking to ensure a seamless product. The mosaics were color balanced, dodged, feathered and smoothed to complete the mosaic.

This Imagery project was handled predominately by the TNRIS Internship program. This project created the opportunity for Interns to learn important and valuable skills relating to the GIS industry. In addition to professional practices, interns were trained in several industry software applications. This product afforded the interns the opportunity to produce an important dataset that is distributed to the public.

## Data Access
These datasets are available for purchase from TNRIS for standard historical imagery pricing.
