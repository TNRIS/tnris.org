## What are we Looking At?

<p class="lead">This figure shows the earliest historical imagery in the TNRIS historical archive for each county in Texas dating back to our earliest collection, the Fairchild 1927 imagery of downtown Dallas. The collections represented by this figure vary in coverage, source, format and scale.</p>

All imagery datasets represented by this figure are available from the TNRIS Research and Distribution center by visiting the [DataHub](https://data.tnris.org).

## Where Did the Data Come From?

This dataset was created by using our Historical Aerial Imagery Index which will be coming to our website later this year. After its launch, the index can be used to view the source, date, scale and format by county for all historical aerial imagery within the TNRIS archive.
