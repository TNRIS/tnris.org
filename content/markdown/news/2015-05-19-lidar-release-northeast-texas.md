The Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) is pleased to announce the release of newly acquired high resolution Lidar data for 2,729 square miles including portions of Smith, Van Zandt, Wood, Upshur, Henderson, Anderson, Freestone, Navarro, Kaufman, Ellis and Dallas Counties in North Texas.  Aerial collection took place from January 25, 2014 to February 18, 2014 during the leaf-off season.  Atkins teamed with McKim & Creed and Williams Aerial Mapping to perform data acquisition/processing while Fugro Geospatial provided third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC).

This project was administered by the TNRIS Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) and the data were procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s (CCG) High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract.  Funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) and the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB).
