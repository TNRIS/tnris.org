Todd Humphreys, an assistant professor at UT Austin's Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, is at the leading edge of research in numerous subjects. He has distinguised himself researching the vulnerabilities of Drones/UAVs to hacking, aka [GPS Spoofing](http://www.ae.utexas.edu/news/features/todd-humphreys-research-team-demonstrates-first-successful-gps-spoofing-of-uav).

> Humphreys said his research team wanted to demonstrate the potential risks associated with spoofing early on in the Federal Aviation Administration’s task to write the mandated rules that will allow government and commercial drones in the U.S. airspace by 2015.

> "We're raising the flag early on in this process so there is ample opportunity to improve the security of civilian drones from these attacks, as the government is committed to doing," Humphreys said.
