    A collaborative initiative to capture high-quality Lidar data for Brazos County, Texas
---

The Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) is pleased to announce the release of newly acquired high resolution Lidar data for 286 square miles of Brazos County, Texas. Aerial collection took place February 9-10, 2015, during the leaf-off season. [Dewberry](http://www.dewberry.com/services/geospatial) performed data acquisition/processing while [Surveying and Mapping, LLC](http://www.sam.biz/) provided third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC).

This project was administered by the TNRIS Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) and the data were procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s (CCG) High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract. Funding was provided by the [City of College Station](http://www.cstx.gov/), [City of Bryan](https://www.bryantx.gov/) and [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/).
