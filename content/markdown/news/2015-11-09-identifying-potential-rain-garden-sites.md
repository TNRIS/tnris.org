## What are we Looking At?

Slowing storm water down, spreading it out, and allowing it to soak in facilitates natural attenuation of contaminants, groundwater recharge, and pre-development hydrology. Full infiltration rain gardens are one type of Low Impact Development (LID) storm water feature. This weighted suitability site selection analysis GIS project consisted of two phases â€“ first, identifying potential full infiltration rain garden locations in Travis County, and then siting a rain garden within a specific parcel.
