### 1st Place Winner of the [2015 Texas GIS Forum Poster Gallery](/news/2015-11-11/poster-gallery-winners-2015-gis-forum)

### Map created by Rebecca Broadbent - [Austin Community College](http://www.austincc.edu/)


## What are we Looking At?

The purpose of this map project is to combine a love of genealogy with a love of Geographic Information Systems. The project takes a dataset commonly used in genealogical research (the census) and adds a spatial component to it. The resulting map provides a visual representation of the spatial and quantitative distribution of common surnames in England and Wales based on the 1881 British Census. The map is patterned after the “Geo-Genealogy of Irish Surnames” map created by Dr. Kenneth Field.

## Where Did the Data Come From?

The 1881 British Census data was provided by the North Atlantic Population Project. Information can be found at https://www.nappdata.org/napp/

Historic Counties data comes from Historic County Borders Project and was downloaded from http://www.county-borders.co.uk/hcbp_4.htm#section2

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90 meter global elevation data was downloaded from http://www.sharegeo.ac.uk/handle/10672/5.
