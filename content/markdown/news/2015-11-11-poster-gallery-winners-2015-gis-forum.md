The 2015 Texas GIS Forum Poster Gallery had another impressive field of submissions, all of them presenting interesting data and analysis with cartographic flair. But out of the dozen maps, there were three that took top honors based on voting from Forum attendees.

This year was dominated by students in GIS programs, illustrating the rising talent in the field. First and third place were collected by [Austin Community College](http://www.austincc.edu/) students, while second place went to students from [Stephen F. Austin State University](http://www.sfasu.edu/).
