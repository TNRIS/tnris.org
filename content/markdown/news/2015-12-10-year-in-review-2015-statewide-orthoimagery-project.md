<p class="lead">The 2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project, undertaken in collaboration with other state agency partners, is one of the major data projects underway at TNRIS. It meets the crucial need for new high-quality, leaf-off imagery for the entire state. As part of TNRIS's key mission to acquire data and distribute it to the public, all of the data produced through the project will be in the public domain and available through our <a href="https://data.tnris.org">data download</a> page.</p>

We wanted to take this opportunity as 2015 comes to a close to fill you in on where the project has been and what's expected in 2016. We've accomplished a lot - we've started to release finalized data - but have also encountered some setbacks. Even with a delay to the original completion date, the project has gone exceptionally well, especially in the hands of the selected data acquisition vendor [Surdex Corp](https://www.surdex.net).

<p>Read on to learn about the current dataset availability, the causes for data acquisition flight delays and the next steps. For the full background and history on the project, visit the project page.</p>

<h2>Latest Data Access Status</h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
  <p>We have created a primary dataset entry for the <b>2015 Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP)</b> in our <a href="https://data.tnris.org">DataHub</a> for the imagery we've QC'ed (Quality Controlled) and finalized so far, which as of early December, is around <b>36% of the state</b>. This imagery primarily consists of <b>West Texas</b> and the <b>Panhandle</b>. <b>El Paso</b> is the most prominent urban center available in this round of data. On about a monthly basis, we are incorporating the latest finalized data into this dataset as it is QC'd and processed.</p>
  <p>In the map thumbnails (click to expand) to the right, you can view the most recent DOQQ and CCM (Compressed County Mosaic) availability. These maps are updated with each round of data additions on the project page.</p>

  <h3>TOP 2015 Online Mapping Service</h3>
  <p>In addition, we have launched a Web Mapping Service (WMS) for the 2015 TOP. You'll be able to access the imagery without downloading and have immediate access to the most current version as the dataset is updated.</p>
  <p>To use WMS services in your CAD or GIS software package, please consult the software help or support information.</p>

<h3>6-Inch and 1-Foot Buy-Up Areas</h3>

<p>Our BUY-UP 6-inch and 1-foot areas were parts of the state sponsored by stakeholders seeking higher resolution imagery for their areas. </p>

<p>6,930 total square miles of 6-inch natural color and color infrared orthoimagery were independently QC’d and are now available for download.</p>

<p>The project has gone smoothly, in no small part thanks to the expertise and high quality service of the project vendor, Surdex. We've flown 91% of the state and been able to process and release 36% of the dataset as of December.</p>

<p>But due to significant rainfall and cloudy weather (as El Niño revved up in 2014), we were not able to meet the original stated completion date of September 2015, pushing us to a revised full statewide data completion date in Spring 2016.</p>

<p>Surdex will fly the remaining areas in the next leaf-off season, starting now in December 2015 and going through February 2016.</p>

<p>In other parts of the state, specfically, the border regions (<em>see map to right</em>), logistical issues have held up flight progress. In order to meet the image coverage requirements along the international border, Surdex must fly 15-20 miles into Mexican territory. This requires a thorough permitting process in coordination with Mexican Government authorities.</p>
