The [Texas Water Development Board](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/), the parent agency of TNRIS, has released the **DRAFT version of the 2017 State Water Plan**. The public comment period for the plan is open until 5:00 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016.

For the first time, there is an online interactive version of the draft plan, increasing the reach and access of the DRAFT Water Plan to the public more than ever. TNRIS developers, alongside other TWDB agency staff, played a vital role in the development of the online version, employing the latest techniques to present the data in clear and understandable online maps and information tables.

> “For the first time, the Draft 2017 State Water Plan includes an online, interactive website as an integral component of the plan,” said TWDB Board member Kathleen Jackson. “This addition is a significant achievement for the state, as it allows the public to take an up-close look at water planning data specific to their county or city. Technology is a key part of the plan and by engaging the public through the interactive website, we have the ability to broaden our reach when it comes to educating Texans on the future of water in our state.”
> 
> The combined information of the interactive website and the Draft 2017 State Water give Texans more in-depth information about water planning than ever before.
> 
> “The state water plan spells out approximately 5,500 strategies Texas communities will use to meet their water needs over the next 50 years, at a total capital cost of $62.6 billion,” said TWDB Board member Peter Lake. “The plan underscores the importance of implementing the projects in the state water plan. Without those projects in place, Texas will face an 8.9 million acre-foot shortage of water in 2070 in a drought and economic losses of approximately $151 billion by 2070.”

> Interested stakeholders who are unable to attend the hearing can submit written comments to Connie Sanders, Office of General Counsel, TWDB, P.O. Box 13231, Austin, Texas 78711-3231 or via email to PUBLIC-COMMENT@twdb.texas.gov.
