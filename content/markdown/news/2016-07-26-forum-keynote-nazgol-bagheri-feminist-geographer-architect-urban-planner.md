<p class="lead"><a class="btn btn-lg btn-success pull-right" href="/texas-gis-forum/2016">Visit the 2016 Forum Home</a> TNRIS is proud to announce <strong>Nazgol Bagheri</strong>, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and Geography at the <a href="http://colfa.utsa.edu/polisci-geography/faculty/bagheri">University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)</a>, as the keynote speaker for the 2016 Texas GIS Forum, on Thursday, October 27th. Trained as an architect and Urban Planner, Bagheri has transitioned to Geography, employing her other backgrounds to analyze space and social relations, particularly along lines of gender.</p>

Dr. Bagheri was born and grew up in Tehran, Iran. She started to enjoy the complexity of urban landscapes in high school when she observed the city while riding the bus. She received a Bachelor of Architecture in September 2004, a Bachelor of Computer Science in September 2006, and a Master of Urban Design in November 2007 from the National University of Iran. She worked as an architect for urban projects at an international design firm between 2004 and 2007. She earned her Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Geography and Sociology from University of Missouri-Kansas City in 2013.

Her focus as a feminist geographer combines the feminist analysis of societal systems with the geographer's lens towards space. Nazgol employs feminist politics and theories to understand how spatial patterns and gender relations are mutually structured and transformed. Unlike most traditional thinking in geography, this approach challenges hegemonic theories and examines the everyday life of everyday people.

Dr. Bagheri is interested in navigating disciplinary terrain in Geography, Urban Planning, and Social Anthropology to develop a working theoretical model to account for changes in the use and design of public space and the unique relationship between the aesthetics of modern planning, the gendering of spatial boundaries, and the contingent nature of public space in Middle Eastern contexts.
