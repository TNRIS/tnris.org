The [2016 Texas GIS Forum](/texas-gis-forum/2016) has passed but we're happy to share some memories of this great event through videos available here and posted to our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOO8R_2mqBDNmVhgxyTcTzw).

The forum intro brought together infamous TNRIS 'employee', Geoff Isaac Stewart, and TWDB Chairman Bech Bruun. We've also posted the highly anticipated video from both of our fantastic keynotes.

Please enjoy and share with the GIS community. Thanks again for making it a great event and stay tuned for announcements about the 2017 forum. It will be our 30th Forum and we plan to make it a big one!
