## 3rd Place - Texas Interstate Compact Basins

### Created by: Prescott Christian of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality

This map was created to assist TCEQ staff with information related to the boundary watersheds governed by the Texas Interstate River Compacts. Each compact includes unique accounting rules and compliance requirements depending on the watershed characteristics and concerns of the member states. Integral to these requirements are the locations of USGS streamflow gaging stations, major reservoirs, sub-basin watersheds, and related water features. Providing this key information for all the compact basins on one map has proved to be a valuable resource and convenient reference tool for the compact engineer advisers from TCEQ.
