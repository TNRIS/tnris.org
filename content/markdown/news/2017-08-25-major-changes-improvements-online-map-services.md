<p class="lead">Effective August 31, all online map services will migrate to a different cloud provider.</p>

## What this change means to you:

- The URL for all raster and vector services will change.
- Web services URLs will be consolidated.
- Web services will continue to be hosted as both ArcGIS and WMS services.
- Fewer Orthoimagery web mapping services will be available, however they will continue to be available through our <a href="https://data.tnris.org">DataHub</a>.
- All NAIP, TOP, and StratMap image datasets will continue to be offered as web map services.

## The benefits to you:
- Increase in speed and image quality.
- Increase in number of vector services published.

Also, weâ€™re investigating the potential to publish elevation data services. Stay tuned for this update!
