Esri has played a key role in the <a href="/texas-gis-forum/2017">Texas GIS Forum</a> beginning in 1987 when Jack Dangermond, the founder of Esri, was the keynote speaker. Every year since then Esri has actively participated in the Forum, supporting not only the event, but the entire Texas GIS community.

This year we're proud to welcome Bern Szukalski, Esri's well known and highly regarded technical and product evangelist, to kick off this year's event. His experiences provide a perspective only someone who has dedicated his career to GIS can describe.

<p class="lead">Bern has witnessed the development of GIS from the mid-80s when he began his geospatial career with Esri as an applications specialist. His abilities were quickly recognized, providing him with opportunities to be involved in a broad spectrum of GIS implementation and software development projects.</p>

<p class="lead">Highlights of his career include authoring Esri’s first user call and bug tracking system, developing the first GUI for ARC/INFO (ArcTools), and teaching/promoting Avenue (scripting language for ArcView 2.0). Bern has also served as the product manager for MapObjects, MapObjects IMS, ArcIMS, ArcGIS Explorer Desktop, and ArcGIS Online. In addition to ArcGIS Online, he’s recently been involved with product management for the Living Atlas and Story Maps.</p>

<p class="lead">The depth of Bern’s professional experience and knowledge keep him in high demand for worldwide workshops and keynote engagements. As a product strategist and technical evangelist, he focuses on ways to broaden access to geographic information and GIS capabilities via the web. Through it all, he remains humble and entirely fascinated by the ever-evolving state of GIS and its capabilities to make a difference.</p>

<p class="lead">He's been known to say that on a good day he's making a map, and on a great day, he's on one.</p>

<p class="lead">Bern will speak at <strong>9:30AM on Wednesday, October 25 in Big Tex.</strong><br><a href="/texas-gis-forum/2017/agenda" class="btn btn-lg btn-darkgrey">View Full Forum Agenda</a></p>
