- Convenient and inexpensive subscription service to access over $20 million worth of quality aerial imagery for Texas via WMTS/WMS links;
- 6-inch pixel resolution, natural color imagery from Google that can be used in your GIS or online map applications;
- Continuous and automatic imagery refresh cycles that provide updated imagery every three years, more frequently for many urban areas;
- Access to metadata to better understand when the imagery was acquired;
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure that guarantees reliable and instant access to imagery and eliminates local data storage and management costs; and
- Continued access to older versions of Google imagery as new imagery becomes available.
