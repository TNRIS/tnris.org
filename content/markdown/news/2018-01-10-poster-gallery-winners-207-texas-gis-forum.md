## 3rd Place - Visualizing our Commute Experience

### Created by: Holly Wiese – Austin Community College

In the fall of 2016 Travis County held a series of public meetings and conducted an on‐line survey to gather input from the public. Close to 3000 people took the survey and provided feedback to Travis County about their transportation concerns and ideas. This poster looks at the comments section of the survey in order to visualize the collective transportation experience of people in Travis County.
