The first two years of the <a href="/stratmap/stratmap-contracts">StratMap/DIR Contracts</a> have been a huge success! Since early 2016, over 270 government agencies across Texas have used the contracts to purchase over 90 geospatial services or data products and over 400 geospatial software licenses.

The StratMap/DIR Contracts provide savings in ease of use and deep discounts to state, regional and local Texas government agencies. Geospatial services, products and software are provided by 17 pre-qualified vendors, each with a Department of Information Resources (DIR) itemized pricing index and associated % discounts.

Services and products range from public safety GIS data analysis and management systems training to road centerline updates/development and new orthoimagery/lidar/ground control services, to name a few. Software licensing and maintenance are also available for purchase using these existing state contracts with leading GIS companies.
