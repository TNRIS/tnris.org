We left out a saucer of warm milk and **the GISCAT Came Back!**

[The dream of the 90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZt-pOc3moc) is alive in TNRIS! Back by popular demand, we've revived a TNRIS initiative that we believe achieved one of the most innovative, efficient, and comprehensive ways to browse our wide array of data holdings - **GISCAT**.

[Data Search & Download](https://data.tnris.org)? The [DataHub](https://data.tnris.org)? You won't be needing those anymore. They have obviously become cumbersome and far too elaborate for common GIS users and data seekers. The TNRIS Information Services Team thinks you will leave them behind to ride the GISCAT into the data horizon.

**GISCAT (Geospatial Information System Catalog)** was originally created in 1996 by former GIS Coordinator Andrew Poth as the mechanism to organize all of TNRIS's data into a central location. As a simple, downloadable 2.5 MB PDF, GISCAT is capable of delivering to all users a listing of the available data. Users can keep the GISCAT PDF local to their own network for easy reference and speedy data access. The GISCAT PDF can be read with modern software such as Acrobat Reader (included in the download). Each dataset listed within the PDF contains metadata and descriptions detailing each dataset as well as an FTP link to download the dataset.

In honor of our mission of making GIS data accessible to the public, the IS Team is proud to bring this piece of our GIS history back to you, including its broken links to non-existent FTP sites. It's a good thing today is April Fool's, or that might be kind of annoying!
