High resolution 6-inch aerial imagery are now available from TNRIS for Smith County and the surrounding East Texas area. Six local entities contributed funds to collect the new imagery.

- City of Tyler
- East Texas Council of Governments
- Smith County
- Smith County 9-1-1
- Smith County Appraisal District
- Texas Eastern 9-1-1

Surdex Corp. was selected from the Strategic Mapping (StratMap) state contract as the orthoimagery data provider. The TNRIS StratMap Program administered the project providing coordination and project management services. TNRIS also performed QA/QC for the project which included inspection of interim and final orthoimagery products.

The new orthoimagery are used for city engineering and planning, emergency 9-1-1 routing, appraisal valuations, infrastructure mapping, and other applications.

The new orthoimagery were acquired in early January 2018 during leaf-off conditions. Leaf-off imagery allows the user to identify more on-the-ground features underneath deciduous tree cover than imagery acquired during full leaf-out time periods. Further, the difference between deciduous and evergreen vegetation is easier to identify in imagery acquired during the leaf-off period.
