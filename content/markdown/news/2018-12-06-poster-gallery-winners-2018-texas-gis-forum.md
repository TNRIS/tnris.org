## 1st Place - The Hunt for Lost Doctor Who Episodes

### Created by: Lance Yarema - City of Tyler, Texas

Doctor Who is the world√≠s longest sci-fi series produced by the BBC. However, many episodes during the 1960s remain missing due to the BBC archive policy at the time. In the past decades, copies of once lost episodes have been recovered through private collectors or overseas television broadcasters. This map depicts countries where episodes have been recovered as well as potential locations for future recoveries.

## 3rd Place - 2D and 3D Edwards Aquifer Structural Visualization

### Created by: Ned Troshanov and Sarah Eason - Edwards Aquifer Authority

ArcGIS Desktop was used to develop a spatial geometry model of the Edwards Aquifer (San Antonio segment), its overlying overburden, underlying confining unit, and outcropped basaltic intrusions. An extensive Model Builder tool was created to make the processing of new data efficient and repeatable. New processes for creating user-defined cross-sections have been created to provide further understanding of the underground structural details.
