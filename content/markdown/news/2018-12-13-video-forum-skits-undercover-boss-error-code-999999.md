<p class="lead">We always enjoy putting together special segments for the forum to show the lighter side of things at TNRIS. This year, we got a visit from a not-so-well-disguised, undercover boss, Director Peter Lake, and also got into the head of a TNRIS developer tortured by a persistent error code. Enjoy both below.</p>

Chairman Peter Lake of the Texas Water Development Board goes undercover as student intern, 'Skeeter', to see how TNRIS operates when the boss isn't looking. He's happy to see that his good friend,  Geoff Isaac Stewart, is there to keep everything moving smoothly along.

TNRIS developer, Adam, just wants to carry out a simple coding function. Error Code 999999 has other plans in store for him.
