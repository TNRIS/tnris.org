Leon Logothetis is a global adventurer, motivational speaker & philanthropist. It wasn’t always that way. He used to be a broker in the city of London where he felt uninspired and chronically depressed. He gave it all up for a life on the road. This radical life change was inspired by the inspirational movie The Motorcycle Diaries.

As host of the Netflix series, The Kindness Diaries, Leon circumnavigated the globe on his vintage yellow motorbike ‘Kindness One’, giving life-changing gifts along the way to unsuspecting good Samaritans. All of this whilst relying on the kindness of strangers. He recently returned from filming the second season of The Kindness Diaries in which he traveled from Alaska to Argentina in his vintage yellow VW Beetle Kindness Two, changing lives one mile at a time.
