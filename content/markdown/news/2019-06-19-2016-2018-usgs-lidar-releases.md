The Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) is pleased to announce the release of about 35,000 square miles of recently acquired high resolution lidar data for five USGS collections from 2016-2018. Aerial collection took place during the leaf-off season in Texas.

The primary purpose of these projects was to develop consistent and accurate USGS Quality Level 2 (QL2) elevation datasets from high-accuracy lidar.

Details regarding these acquisitions can be found by downloading the supplemental reports found in the datahub entries listed below.
