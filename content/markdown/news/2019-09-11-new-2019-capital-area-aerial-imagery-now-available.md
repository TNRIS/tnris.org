- Brazos Central Appraisal District
- Brazos County 9-1-1
- Capital Area Emergency Communications District
- City of Austin
- City of Bastrop
- City of Bee Cave
- City of Bryan
- City of Burnet
- City of College Station
- City of Round Rock
- City of West Lake Hills
- Hays County
- Texas A&M University
- Texas Municipal Power Agency

[Fugro USA Land](https://www.fugro.com/our-services/asset-integrity/mapping-and-surveying) was selected under the [Strategic Mapping (StratMap) state contract](https://www.tnris.org/stratmap/stratmap-contracts/) as the orthoimagery data provider. The TNRIS StratMap Program administered the project providing coordination and project management services. TNRIS also performed QA/QC for the project which included inspection of interim and final orthoimagery products.

The new orthoimagery are used for city engineering and planning, emergency 9-1-1 routing, infrastructure mapping, and other applications.

The new orthoimagery were acquired in January 2019 during leaf-off conditions. Leaf-off imagery allows the user to identify on-the-ground features underneath deciduous tree cover than imagery acquired during full leaf-on time periods. Further, the difference between deciduous and evergreen vegetation is easier to identify in imagery acquired during the leaf-off period.

## Data Access

The GeoTIFFs and JPEG2000 images are in the public domain. The JPEG2000s are available for direct download from the DataHub.
