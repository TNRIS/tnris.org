In collaboration with stakeholders from across Texas, TNRIS created a statewide standardized GIS land parcel schema. This format of land parcel data consists of the most commonly utilized information as determined by a land parcel committee of our peers. Data contributed from county appraisal districts, or their service providers, were translated into this common schema and are now available for download on the [TNRIS DataHub](https://data.tnris.org/collection/2679b514-bb7b-409f-97f3-ee3879f34448).

229 of 253 appraisal district datasets are available in GIS format in the common schema. Twenty five datasets are temporarily licensed for public agency use only. For more information on the status of geographic land parcel data in Texas, see the [August 2019 Update Report](https://cdn.tnris.org/documents/update-on-digital-parcel-data-in-texas-20190903.pdf) on digital parcel data in Texas. Program details are updated on the [Land Parcels page under StratMap](/stratmap/land-parcels), including frequently asked questions and timeline.

All land parcel data are provided in a single coordinate system (WGS84 Web Mercator) that is the recommended standard for sharing GIS data on the Web.

**Each land parcel dataset on DataHub consists of a zip file including:**

- File geodatabase
- Shapefile
- Conversion file (field mappings from the source to the common schema)
- Metadata
