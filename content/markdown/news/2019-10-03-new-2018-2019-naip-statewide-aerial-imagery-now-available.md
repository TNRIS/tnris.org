High resolution 60-cm (2-foot) aerial imagery are now available statewide from TNRIS.
This orthoimagery dataset was acquired by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) during the 2018 agricultural growing season and through the winter and spring of 2019 (May 2018 - April 2019), resulting in a mix of leaf-on/leaf-off conditions statewide in Texas. The entire dataset is available at 60-cm (2-foot) pixel resolution. This pixel resolution allows the user to identify features on the ground such as sheds, helipad markings, driveways, car ports, medians, and bike lanes. The entire dataset is available as a 4-band (RGBIR) product which allows the user to display the imagery in natural color (RGB) or color infrared (IRRG).

_The 2018-19 NAIP dataset does NOT included compressed county mosaics (CCMs) as they were not funded by the program this time._

NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City, Utah. The program was established to support FSA's strategic goals centered on agricultural production. NAIP imagery are used for a wide variety of purposes throughout the state including land use planning, natural resource assessment, energy production, transportation, emergency management, ecology, air quality monitoring, etc.

NAIP acquisitions in Texas are contracted based on available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Since 2008, NAIP statewide imagery have been acquired for Texas on a 2-year cycle. This refresh rate allows the user to conduct change detection studies that can be used to monitor climate patterns such as drought or to show the rate of manmade growth on the fringes of urban development.

_Note: Per FSA, full coverage along the TX/MX border is not available in some areas and some DOQQ tiles contain black no data areas along the TX/MX border. Cities such as Brownsville, Pharr, south McAllen, Mission, Rio Grande City, and Eagle Pass are NOT available._

## Data Access

The GeoTIFFs and JPEG2000 images are in the public domain. The JPEG2000s are available for direct download from the DataHub.
