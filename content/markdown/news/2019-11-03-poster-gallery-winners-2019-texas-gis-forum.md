## 1st Place - Do Playgrounds Matter?

### Created by: Janine Gillot, Austin Community College

The results of this ACC Capstone project point to the benefit that playground trees give to lower income students. Disadvantaged students who have larger playground tree canopies have higher math test scores and fewer behavioral infractions. This study looked at a local school district covering parts of Leander, Cedar Park, Austin, and Georgetown.
