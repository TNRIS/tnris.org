Our state statute establishes TNRIS “as a centralized clearinghouse and referral center for:” specific data, including census data. Though TNRIS no longer handles requests for population data, TNRIS remains a state partner with the U.S. Census via the State Demographer and the Texas Demographic Center. For the state demographer and the U.S. Census, the biggest and most important task is the fast approaching decennial population count. Extensive work and preparations leading up to the April 1 population count have been taking place throughout the state.

The Texas Demographic Conference, an annual conference hosted by the Texas Demographic Center was held the first week of June 2019. The main takeaways for this year’s conference were the availability of online resources of census information, tools, and data products, and a strong message to “Make Texas count!” Several state agency executives, community leaders, and one state representative gave testimony on the importance of counting every person in the state. The importance of Census data includes:

-   Determining Texas representation in Washington, DC as well as legislative districts within our state;
-   Guiding the allocation of over $675 billion in federal dollars invested in our communities;
-   Informing planning for health, education, transportation, and other services;
-   Assisting businesses in locating factories & stores and recruiting employees; and
-   Serving as the building block for nearly all demographic and socio-economic statistics for the next 10 years.  

For our agency, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), population figures are essential to our mission. TWDB relies on accurate counts and future population projections to determine water needs for the next 50 years. Furthermore, TWDB grants financial assistance to rural, underserved communities for water infrastructure projects based on the number of people served.

For several decades, the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) partnered with the United States Census Bureau (U.S. Census), serving as the state’s central data center for each decennial census until the early-2000s. Requests for population information came in from all corners of the state, prompting staff to pull notebooks containing computer tapes and eventually compact discs to produce paper reports of a specific socioeconomic or demographic population. Cities and towns relied on population counts to receive the appropriate amount of infrastructure funding and social programs for their residents. Our diligence in pulling the correct information helped communities get the services and funding they needed.

While this process is now centralized at the federal level, it still requires partnerships with state governments. State funding to promote, educate, and locate hard-to-count communities is not widely available in Texas. However, leaders throughout the state are working hard to ensure an accurate and complete count of Texans in 2020.

Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs recently convened a roundtable discussion of state agencies to coordinate efforts with the U.S. Census to achieve a complete count in the state. The Secretary of State’s efforts compliment the on-going _Texas Counts_ Campaign, a statewide collaboration of community-based and philanthropic organizations spearheaded by the Center for Public Policy Priorities and Community Foundations of Texas.

Texas Counts works with cross-sector leaders and organizations to promote engagement with the 2020 Census and supports and amplifies local level efforts throughout Texas. The campaign website, [TexasCounts.org](https://texascounts.org), offers resources, best practices, connections with other Census Champions in the discussion forum, and applications for funding and assistance.

As GIS professionals, the importance of census data was understood before we made our first map. And when the time came for us to make a map, we used the Census TIGER files for our road centerlines and place boundaries. Analysis of demographics came shortly thereafter, building choropleth maps to show population density or per-capita income in the U.S. The GIS community still relies on the Census data, not only for its rich demographic data, but as a fundamental piece of all GIS work. As devout users of census products, our collective support for the decennial census is paramount. Companies and organizations will rely on us to perform population trend analysis for marketing, planning, and problem solving. We are excited to do our part to ensure a complete count in the 2020 Census.

## Let’s help make Texas count!
