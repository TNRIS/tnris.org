<p>
  TNRIS is working with our training partners to transition from our traditional in-person classes to self-paced or instructor-led remote sessions.  The details are being finalized with the full schedule update soon to follow.
</p>

<p>
  The changes will be consistent with our dedication to high quality training presented by experienced instructors at discounted price for topics GIS professionals can use to update and enhance their technical skills.
</p>

<p>
  Self-paced and instructor-led online training provide students the opportunity to select an instruction delivery method that meets their learning style and preferences. Online training also offers quality content at a reduced price.  The importance of this cannot be overlooked as the state is facing economic challenges.
</p>

<p>
  The Education page will be updated soon to reflect the new training schedule with open registration.
