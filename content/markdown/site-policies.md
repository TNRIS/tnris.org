## Accessibility Policy

### Policy Intention

The intention of this policy is to state clear accessibility principles that all Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) websites must follow.

The TWDB strives to ensure all of its websites comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) when possible without causing undue burden to the agency. Due to current technology constraints, there are some instances where the TWDB is unable to provide information in an accessible format (e.g. mapping information). The TWDB will be monitoring these sections and will develop accessible solutions as technology improves. In order to ensure no user is disadvantaged, the TWDB will respond to all accessibility assistance requests by either altering the necessary content as soon as possible or, if requested, by providing the information in an alternative format at no cost to the user within a reasonable timeframe. It is the responsibility of the content owner to provide these alternative formats. The TWDB websites will provide appropriate channels of communication that allow visitors to request alternative formats and to give feedback about any accessibility problems.

### Policy Dimensions
For the purpose of this policy, the term "websites" includes:
- All websites (public and non-authenticated) managed and maintained by the TWDB staff or on the behalf of the TWDB, including, all external websites using the .twdb.texas.gov domain, agency ancillary sites, and social media sites.
- All material associated with pages on the website such as documents, audio, video and any other additional files except for maps.


### To Get Information in a Different Format
