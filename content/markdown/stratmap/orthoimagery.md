      <p class="lead"><strong>Orthoimagery</strong> is digital aerial photography that has been geometrically corrected (orthorectified) to remove distortion caused by camera optics, aircraft tilt, and differences in ground elevation.</p>
      <p class="lead">The publicly available statewide orthoimagery datasets from TNRIS have either 0.5-meter or 1-meter pixel resolution. This level of image detail is used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information. </p>

  <h2>StratMap Orthoimagery Datasets</h2>
  <h3>Statewide Datasets</h3>
  <p class="lead">Leveraging funds from multiple government agencies (State, Federal, and Local), the StratMap Program coordinated statewide orthoimagery acquisitions starting in the mid-1990s which also began the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP).</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p>Since then, the state has been refreshed with new orthoimagery in 2004 at 1-meter, 2008/09 at 0.5-meter (under TOP) & 1-meter, and 2010 at 1-meter, all in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/">National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)</a> administered by the USDA-Farm Service Agency-Aerial Photography Field Office.</p>
      <p>The USDA NAIP continues to refresh Texas statewide with new orthoimagery every two years at 1-meter pixel resolution (2012, 2014, 2016) during the leaf-on growing season (April â€“ October acquisitions). </p>
      <p>Pooling State funds again in 2014, StratMap coordinated a new TOP statewide 0.5-meter leaf-off acquisition that occurred during the 2014/15 (91% of state) & 2015/16 (9% of state) winter seasons.</p>

      <h3>Regional Datasets</h3>
      <p class="lead">Since 2009, the StratMap Program has coordinated numerous higher resolution (6-inch/1-foot) orthoimagery regional acquisition projects within Texas. Our contracting vehicle, the <a href="/stratmap/stratmap-contracts">StratMap Contracts</a> process, provides an efficient way to procure new orthoimagery from a list of prequalified geospatial data product and services vendors.</p>
