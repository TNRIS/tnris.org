<p>The <a href="https://dir.texas.gov/">Department of Information Resources (DIR)</a> maintains multiple Cooperative Contracts which are designed to strengthen Texasâ€™ capabilities to procure quality digital map data, services, and software. The contracts are for use by customers that include Texas state, regional, and local government offices, including river and water authorities, and public education entities. The process for procuring GIS products, services, and software is administered by TNRIS and known as the Texas Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Contracts.</p>

<p>The StratMap/DIR Contracts are awarded to companies that are technically evaluated by a team of GIS professionals and determined to provide quality geographic data products, services, and GIS software. The availability of these contracts streamlines the procurement process and provides beneficial competition among some of the best companies in the industry.
</p>

<p>The StratMap/DIR Contracts are truly a representation of successful public and private partnerships across Texas!
</p>

<p>To review a list of products, services, or software and associated % discounts, see the Pricing Index for each vendor on their DIR Vendor Contract page.</p>

                                    <h3>Strategic Collaboration</h3>
                  Bringing together professional expertise across the geospatial community enhances project specifications, provides volume pricing opportunities, and results in better quality of data products.
                  <h3>Taxpayer Value</h3>
                  By combining our geospatial projects, we can acquire a larger area at a pre-negotiated discounted unit price and reduce duplication. Each product, service, and software available from the DIR/StratMap Contracts has an associated % discount.
                  <h3>Efficient Purchasing Process</h3>
                  Because competitively bid master contracts are already in place, the contracting process has been eliminated for you. A statement of work and a purchase order referencing the vendor's StratMap/DIR Contract are all that are needed in most cases. State agencies must follow these <a href="https://pubext.dir.texas.gov/portal/internal/resources/DocumentLibrary/Threshold%20and%20SOW%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf">DIR SOW and Procurement Thresholds</a>.
                  <h3>Project Assistance and Coordination</h3>
                  Part of the value that TNRIS brings to the administration of the StratMap/DIR Contracts is the expertise we offer by introducing you to potential project partners to expand the area of interest or to share the project cost. TNRIS StratMap staff provide guidance through the StratMap/DIR Contracts procurement process and in some cases can provide full project management from project initiation to data deliverables review to project close.
                  <h3>Increased Opportunity for Cost Sharing</h3>
                  By taking the first step to <b><a href="mailto:StratMap@twdb.texas.gov">notify us</a></b> about your potential project, you may be alerted to another entity interested in purchasing a similar product or area of interest.
                  <h3>Pre-screened Companies with Geospatial experience</h3>
                  Each of the selected companies were carefully evaluated for project experience and success. Qualifications include project experience, technology innovation, professional staff, and available resources.

                  Each project performed under the DIR/StratMap Contracts adds to the rich base of existing geographic data at TNRIS and through experience gained, helps to improve data standards and overall project management.
