## What is Standardization?

Standardization is important to eliminate confusion, uncertainty, and misunderstanding. This may occur when:

- More than one name is used for the same place or feature
- The same name is applied to different features
- The spelling of a name is inconsistent.

The end result is incalculable savings in time and money by increasing the efficiency of a nationâ€™s government and other institutions. It can prevent misunderstanding, and just as important, can eliminate the inconsistency that occurs when different agencies try to determine geographic name use. Additionally, correct, consistent geographic names often provide the critical element in emergency response situations for first responders to locate and help protect human lives.

National standardization allows a country to exercise its prerogative to establish its own standard names. This process started in the United States in 1890 when President William Harrison signed an Executive Order creating the United States Board on Geographic Names.
