                  Wetlands maintain critical ecological processes that enhance water quality, support diverse habitat, and provide several other environmental services. Constructed and restored wetlands attempt to mitigate the loss of natural wetlands, improve water quality, meet water supply demands, and support wildlife habitat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 5,762 ha Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area located near Palestine, Texas, features a constructed wetland that covers nearly 900 ha and supports a variety of amphibians, invertebrates, migratory birds, and waterfowl. The wetland system incorporates five sediment basins and 20 inundated cells. As 95% effluent water from the Trinity River flows cell-to-cell, clay substrate and vegetation absorb phosphorus, nitrogen, and other nutrients, which improves water quality before it is returned to the Trinity River. The importance of annual areal vegetation coverage estimates are indicated by the cell-to-cell spatial diversity of vegetation, which fluctuate by abundance, age, and species. Mapping vegetation is essential to evaluate the biodiversity, overall health, and success of the restored wetland system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Fall 2014, Meadows Center for Water and the Environment used an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect high-resolution imagery (18 cm) of the wetland cells. Ground truth data, including species composition denoted by point, transect, and polygon units, were collected using Trimble Geo XH units to ensure accurate geo-location. Imagery was processed with Agisoft’s Photoscan and ArcGIS software. Using ground truth data, estimated vegetation cover was classified using two approaches: a supervised pixel-based method completed with ERDAS Imagine and an object-based classification using eCognition Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initial results show that pixel-based classification produces patchy, non-contiguous results known as the ‘salt-and-pepper effect’, whereas object-based classification does not.  Overall, the products derived from object-based image classification offers increased potential to reduce the ‘salt-and-pepper effect’, improve classification accuracy, and enhance visual interpretability. Ultimately, the classification products will contribute to establishment of vegetation response to different restoration practices, geographic patterns of annual growth rates for specific vegetation species, and habitat suitability.

              <p>In the world of oil and gas exploration the land surface is subjected to change with the addition of new roads and drilling rigs that dot the landscape.  The rapid change can negatively affect the environment and ground water resources as well as have an impact on land and mineral ownership issues.  Updating a GIS database to reflect the latest changes in an area of resource exploration can be challenging using manual methods. </p>
              <p>Remote sensing using multiple dates of NAIP imagery from the Texas Natural Resources Information System allows for accurate change detection to help monitor the new additions of roads and drilling sites.  This presentation describes a workflow used to prepare image data, detect new change, and output update features as a vector data set.  By monitoring change in this way, GIS databases can be kept up to date in areas where there is rapid change.</p>

              <p>The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) market is blowing up in the North America, especially with more lenient US FAA regulations already undergoing comment, which means positive changes are imminent. The need exists for a UAV solution to process the image data using Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry applications with possible service to a web client.  Hexagon Geospatial has the technology to put together the complete solution from hardware to the internet from one single vendor.</p>
              <p>In this session we will discuss some of the problems to overcome with these UAV solutions and show many different ways of producing value added data from these UAV’s. Currently in the US you need a pilot license and a certificate of Authorization or 333 to fly in accordance to the FAA.  With basic rules in the US being flying under 400 feet, 5 miles from any airspace and line of sight of the UAV must be less than 1 mile. Attend this session and become more equipped to handle the UAV solution explosion.</p>

            <h4>Innovative Public Health Care GIS Applications</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
             <p>The potential to apply Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies across the public health care field is enormous and just beginning to reap significant benefits.  Health care focused GIS applications require the integration and analysis of diverse, updated, and (at times) proprietary data from such fields as: health, finance, education, sociology, environment, geography, and informatics.</p>
             <p>There is a genuine need to define and map the accessibility to community health resources or assets (i.e., health facilities, education, recreation, transportation, and shopping [i.e., food, medicine, etc.]) and conduct associated spatial gap analyses and ranking. In support of these gap analyses, GIS has also recently been effectively applied to map and expose such community health related disparities as food, medicine, and play “deserts”. </p>
             <p>Sam Houston State University’s (SHSU) Office of Research and Sponsored Program’s (ORSP) new GIS Center and College of Health Sciences are actively working on projects with university (SHSU and Universidad de Iberoamérica [UNIBE]), county (e.g., Montgomery County United Way), regional, and country (Costa Rica) level not-for-profit health care focused organizations. The purpose is to provide the capacity and tools to more systematically and quantitatively generate the necessary metrics and maps to measure, visualize, communicate, and enhance the impact of their various programs in the context of community health outcomes.</p>
             <p>Furthermore, the relationship between existing assets and of social determinants of health are also being emphasized. Through a more quantitative and systematic understanding of existing community resources and needs, as well as funding effectiveness that is directly associated with measurable impacts on community outcomes, these not-for-profits will be able to more strategically create improved partnerships between existing community based organizations with the objective of creating healthy communities.</p>
             <p>This presentation describes the specific tasks, deliverables, and outcomes for each health care not-for-profit’s GIS project that SHSU is working presently on.</p>

            <div class="modal-body"><p>GIS has become an essential element of all types of emergency response at all levels of government (and the private sector): Federal, State and Local. Through a Common Operating Picture (COP), a GIS-based status display is shown through a web map viewer, where a variety of relevant information can be tracked, displayed and queried in real time, from any location.
              <p>In addition, information that is collected in the field by Search &amp; Rescue teams can be instantly integrated into the COP, allowing for those in the Incident Command Post to evaluate the information and dispatch resources such as K9 or helicopter crews to a specific location. </p>
              <p>The evolution of GIS for the Wimberley response from paper maps, to simple web map viewer (COP), to field Collector app and eventually to an Operations Dashboard showing all relevant response information and metrics will be discussed.     (TNRIS provided valuable support to the response by creating a river system layer that was used to create SAR search zones.)</p>

          <h4>Development of a Binational Geospatial Decision Support System to Protect Water Quality in the Lower Rio Grande: An Innovative Use of Open Source Geographic Information System Software</h4>
        </div>
       <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Assessments of water quality in the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir have identified a number of persistent water quality problems in this important transboundary river, including high levels of fecal bacteria and increasing salinity levels.</p>
          <p>In 2013, realizing the need to address water quality concerns in the river in an integrated fashion, the governments of the US and Mexico created a binational forum for cooperation and information exchange under the auspices of the International Boundary and Water Commission.  The effort, known as the Lower Rio Grande/Río Bravo Water Quality Initiative (LRGWQI), is a pilot project designed to establish binational mechanisms to protect water quality in the river.</p>
          <p>Among the technical goals of the LRGWQI is the modeling of pollutant loadings and instream water quality in the river, including simulation of scenarios associated with changing population, infrastructure and management practices.</p>
          <p>In order to facilitate binational decision making associated with this cooperative technical effort, UT’s Bureau of Economic Geology, in collaboration with the UT’s LBJ School of Public Affairs, developed a geospatial decision support system in Python. The GIS functionalities are enabled using the Python-based Application Programming Interface of QGIS, an open source GIS software. SQLite, a serverless, self-contained database system is used for managing user-specified and system configuration data.</p>
          <p>We present the principal capabilities and features of the LRGWQI DSS, discuss some of the challenges we encountered using the QGIS software to develop the application and present some of the modifications and additions we are currently incorporating into the system.</p>

            <p>Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. Learning how to make compelling maps with your own data is a a non-trivial endeavor, involving a concatenation of expertise and technical aptitudes with specialty tools that might be obscure to new mappers, and limits the community as a result.</p>
            <p>At CartoDB (https://carto.com/), we have a series of open source projects to augment the GIS learning experience, with Academy (http://academy.cartodb.com/), our "code academy" for GIS, or our Trainings repository (http://cartodb.github.io/training/), a place to share lessons and workshops and submit events to a collaborative calendar.    We'll talk about the future of education for digital geographers, and how partnering with curriculum producers has fostered a supportive community of stellar mappers across domains.

          <div class="modal-body"><p>Every utility and government has millions invested in buried and/or hidden assets.  With the advancement of GIS we have more accurate location and information on these assets than ever before.  However, still in the field, the assets can be hidden by snow, vegetation, or even purposely in people’s property for aesthetics.  Additionally, despite accurate data, helping the field workers to find the right asset can be challenging, causing repairs and replacements to happen on the wrong assets.</p>
          <p>Technology has made another leap that can help, Augmented Reality.  We will introduce you to a new technology solution that can empower your field workers ‘in the last mile’ to find the correct hidden asset, plan their job, and effectively save time and effort.  We will also discuss how you can implement this into your organization.  Additionally, we will discuss the rapidly changing field of augmented reality and what the future might hold.  Augmented Reality is no longer a subject of science fiction and superhero movies.  It is here and available to improve all of our day to day jobs!</p>

          <div class="modal-body"><p>There are many situations in which users, who may be vastly distributed geographically, require fast interactive access to large geospatial datasets.  These datasets are often comprised of high resolution imagery and LiDAR data.  A traditional approach for providing these products to users involves shipping hard drives which often results in long wait times.  This method is less than ideal since it exposes users to the potential risk of data versioning conflicts.</p>
          <p>Now, there have been several advances in cloud computing and new research in algorithms for managing large volumes of data.  Fusing these two enhancements together provides a practical, reliable and convenient alternative to the distribution of these datasets, while reducing the process friction of the traditional approach.  In this talk, we will outline how such solutions are developed using real-life examples drawn from the need to collaboratively and interactively assess the quality of both imagery and LiDAR data.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>With an approximate population of 6,500 people and 50 miles of roadway, the City of Fair Oaks Ranch is a rapidly growing community situated in the Texas Hill Country. The City has been running a Roadway Maintenance and Repair Program since 1998. All of the City roads are treated with a Chip Seal procedure on an eight (8) year cycle making proper planning and record keeping critical. This program was largely operated from a spreadsheet and blank maps with highlighted roads to communicate project areas to contractors.</p>
            <p>In 2015, the City incorporated AutoCAD and GIS in order to accurately convey this year's project area to the Chip Seal contractor. Furthermore, a program to catalog manhole covers in the project area was implemented to protect them from an inadvertent seal. A Trimble Geolocation Device was utilized to collect data on each manhole cover to be uploaded into the City's GIS system. With the utilization of these technologies, a more accurate estimation of material requirements was completed, resulting in a savings of over $16,000 for the City. This work flow process will continually be implemented for many years of Roadway Maintenance to come.</p>

            <p>On June 2nd, the USGS Texas Water Science Center released the new Texas Geology Web Map Viewer.  The map viewer is an interactive web-based tool that allows a broad range of users to explore the geology of the Lone Star State at a scale of 1:250,000. Users can navigate the map with a simple click-and-point tool, or by using the location search tool to find common geographic place names, latitude/longitude coordinates and other areas of interest. The interactive map viewer allows users to turn data layers on or off, identify layers of interest and retrieve detailed information about each geologic formation, such as the feature name, geologic age and feature description. The web map viewer is the third generation in this series of Texas geologic mapping products, which is intended to provide data to a broad range of users interested in exploring the geology of Texas.</p>
            <p>In October 2002, the USGS Texas Water Science Center, in cooperation with the Texas Natural Resources Information System, embarked on a project to digitize all 38 Geologic Atlas of Texas hardcopy map sheets (UT-Bureau of Economic Geology) and compile them into a single, stand-alone database. Completed in 2007, the project resulted in a rich, digital dataset containing more than 145,000 geologic features in Texas and portions of neighboring states.  The presentation will cover the entire life cycle of the project from data production, to application development and the use of social media outreach tools, as well as the public response</p>

             <p>Our new application hosted on Amazon EC2 makes use of ArcGIS server to surface restful endpoints using query layers that point to data hosted on SQL Server 2012 in spatially enabled views.  The new user interface takes advantage of Bootstrap to provide a user interface that is responsively designed and works on devices of any form factor.
              <p>Great care was taken to build an application that is light on the wire. This has been achieved by optimizing the data that is downloaded within the application and also optimizing our code using ESRI’s Javascript Web  Optimizer.

          <div class="modal-body"><p>The technology group at Drillinginfo, Inc. which includes GIS, Data Dev and IT/CM, has undertaken an effort to provide its customers with a rich set of map and geoprocessing services.  The big opportunity and also the great challenge lies in supporting a variety of O&G industry-standard applications with varying spatial service connection capabilities. This effort dictates that Drillinginfo support both ESRI proprietary protocols as well as Open Source (OGC) protocols within this diverse set of applications.</em>
          <p>Additionally, each application has its own set of challenges with regard to various supported modes of authentication. This presentation will dive into some of the technical hurdles and architecture decisions made to support such a diverse offering. Additionally, this presentation will speak to how the company has partnered with application vendors and clients to achieve successful technical integration. As the GIS industry increasingly ventures into the new managed API economy, this talk will provide valuable insight about hosting spatial web services for integration into non-ESRI-based applications.</p>

In this change detection application, vast amounts of point cloud data were ingested, created, and processed to apply change detection techniques.  Change detection analysis relied on modelling differences in elevation between existing LiDAR (2010) and new aerial imagery (2015).</p>
          <p>The project demonstrates the utility of leveraging existing data in combination with new and diverse image-derived terrain sources such as extremely dense point clouds generated from aerial imagery.</p>

          <div class="modal-body"><p>Recently commercialized, Geiger Mode Avalanche Photodiode (GmAPD) technology provides significant gains in efficiency for airborne LiDAR mapping over the linear mode sensors available on the market today. Along with this dramatic leap in technology comes the need to educate end-users on what to expect from data collected with this new sensor and the impact on current LiDAR workflows.</p>
          <p>This presentation will compare data from GmAPD LiDAR against “traditional” linear mode LiDAR data in the same geographic area and discuss the potential impact of this technology on the user community. Topics to be covered include 1) Overview of the test data 2) Visual comparisons of data in the same geographic area using both “traditional” and GmAPD LiDAR 3) Data quality and accuracy test results 4) Workflow modifications necessary to adapt to GmAPD technology.</p>

          <h4>The Information Commons: Cloud-Based GIS</h4></div>
           <div class="modal-body"><p>With the emergence and rapidly evolving nature of easily accessible web-based GIS technology, there is world-wide phenomena of cartographic "commoning" occurring. In our information-driven world, the traditional notion of "the commons" as a public spaces and shared resources has evolved in many ways away from the analog world.</p>
          <p>Maps, and emerging technologies that put maps in the hands of people, has become the bridge between physical space and technology-driven discourse. Amateur map makers and professionals in non-GIS related fields are breaking the boundaries of conventional GIS practice and creating a movement of people-generated information visualization and data sharing with the capacity to move beyond conventional understandings of geographic information systems while creating large resources of crowd-generated knowledge. </p>
          <p>While some may argue that this notion of a popular mapping culture in some ways dilutes the integrity of geographic science, in reality, fully featured GIS platforms such as CartoDB allow for the once fortified barriers of communication between the science community and people to be softened in ways that rethink how all aspects of data and information science are projected on the mainstream stage. The new geographic paradigm that emerges from this discourse blurs the boundaries between siloed professions such as science and mainstream data uses and communication. Moving forward, we must illuminate the possibilities of a vibrant information commons built on access to maps and information.</p>

          <h4>Modern Web Mapping for Local Governments Delivers Insights into Performance Metrics, Patterns of Change &amp; Distribution of Resources</h4></div>
          <div class="modal-body"><p>Local governments are faced with increasing citizen demands for transparency and accountability. The challenge lies in effectively distributing and presenting diverse information on the services, resources, events and decisions that are shaping the local landscape. While publicly accessible, such information is often scattered across multiple sources and disconnected web pages.</p>
          <p>This presentation will demonstrate how mapping applications can coalesce these disparate sources, providing new views and insights into performance metrics, patterns of change and distribution of resources. The results are higher engagement of residents and visitors, promotion and greater efficiency of government services, and resources for business investment and development decisions.</p>

          <h4>3D Modeling of the City of Temple Landfill</h4></div>
          <div class="modal-body"><p>The primary program I used to create the 3D Model was ESRI's ArcScene 10.0. The Engineering Department at Waste Management provided a number of CAD files showing the topography of the landfill's liner (the bottom), the current level (as of Feb 2014), and the finished grade once the landfill is full. I exported the data into a file geodatabase so I could edit the shapes. Because the CAD files included the topography for the entire property, I had to clip out the areas not relevant to the landfill cell boundaries itself. I then converted each feature into a TIN and using the Delineate TIN Data Area tool, I was able to remove areas along the perimeter with edge lengths that were too long along the outside edges of the landfill area.</p>
          <p>Using the Polygon Volume tool within the 3D Analyst Tool Set, I was able to calculate the volume each feature was in order to determine total capacity. By adding together the liner and current level volumes and the liner and finished grade volumes and then subtracting the two totals, I was able to determine the how full the landfill was as of Feb 2014 by percentage. As the years move forward, I can use this process to calculate how much per year the landfill grows and potentially how many years it will take to completely fill it.

          <h4>Examination of the spatial relationship between development and aquatic nutrient loading in the Galveston Bay Estuary</h4></div>
          <div class="modal-body"><p>Houston-Galveston is one of the fastest growing regions in the United States. With this rapid growth comes increased development and associated impervious surfaces. The Texas Coast, and particularly Galveston Bay, is important economically due to its fisheries and petrochemical industry, as well as for its leisure and tourism industry. Given that the Galveston Bay Estuary (as defined by the National Estuary Program) contains an ecologically unique and diverse ecosystem, and that land use is directly correlated with water quality, understanding how this increase in impervious surface area affects water quality is crucial.</p>
          <p>This study examines the degree to which specific development patterns impact water quality within rivers in the Galveston Bay Estuary. The focus will be on several development metrics such as patch size, density, and proximity to a river evaluated through an analysis using FRAGSTATS and ArcGIS.</p>
          <p>Using GIS and landscape metrics to evaluate the spatial extent of development patterns across the Houston-Galveston region on a watershed level is a relatively new approach and is important for understanding the implications of certain development patterns. The results of this study will provide planners and stakeholders with a better understanding of the effects of development on water quality.

          <div class="modal-body"><p>The Texas General Land Office (GLO) administers the federal Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program for the State of Texas. In 2013, the GLO entered into an agreement with the Gulf Coast Community Preservation and Recovery District (GCCPRD), who hired Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation to lead a multidiscipline team to conduct a Storm Surge Suppression Study, which includes a technical, scientific based effort to investigate opportunities to alleviate the vulnerability of the upper Texas coast to storm surge and flooding in Brazoria, Harris, Galveston, Chambers, Jefferson and Orange counties.</p>
          <p>This study provides the GCCPRD opportunity to work collaboratively with federal, state, local, and public and private institutions to develop a plan that meets the needs of the region and the nation. The team utilizes geospatial technologies to model and analyze protective alternatives and the results are presented to the public through an HTML5 and JavaScript application utilizing a GitHub project called “CMV – The Configurable Map Viewer”. The CMV is built on an Esri ArcGIS Server and SQL Server platform utilizing Esri Basemaps and was chosen as the map viewer template due to its modular design that allows easy custom tailoring to meet the specific needs of the study.</p>

            <p>With large events like SXSW and the US Grand Prix, City officials need a way to track activities around the city and communicate across departments.  Esri’s Collector App and Operations Dashboard gives them the tools to visualize where activities occur, dispatch personnel, and view statistics in real time.  The findings will help plan future events, mitigate issues, and run analysis.  This session can help you learn how to use these apps to manage your field collection needs.</p>

            <h4>3 Words to Address the World</h4></div>
            <div class="modal-body"><p>75% of countries in the world have inadequate or no address system at all. In the remaining 25%, national addressing systems are plagued with problems that cause widespread inefficiency.</p>
    <p>Poor addressing is costly &amp; annoying in some developed countries, and around the world it hampers the growth and development of nations, ultimately costing lives.</p>
    <p>The geospatial industry is worth an estimated $150bn annually yet there is no precise yet simple global address or location reference system.
    The only real option is complicated latitude and longitude coordinate pairs, which are great for machines but ineffective for everyday people.</p>
    <p>what3words have divided the world into 57 trillion 3mx3m squares and given each one a simple and easy to remember 3 word address. Find out the story behind the idea, how it works &amp; who is using it.</p>
    <p>3 word addresses can help delivery, asset management, lone workers, aid delivery and anyone working in developing nations of rural areas.
