TNRIS is pleased to invite you to participate as a presenter in this year's Texas GIS Forum. The Forum doesn't happen without your important contribution!

Please review the suggested topics of interest and the selection criteria prior to submitting an abstract.

## Topics of Interest

 Individuals are invited to propose a GIS-themed presentation. However, special consideration will be given to abstracts relating to the following topics:

- Emerging GIS Technologies

- Mobile or Web GIS Advancements
- GIS in Social Media or Crowdsourcing
- Integrating Open Source tools into GIS Workflows
- New Techniques for Emergency Management
- Innovative Remote Sensing Techniques
- Working with Map Services
