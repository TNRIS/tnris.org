TNRIS is pleased to invite you to participate as a presenter in this year's Texas GIS Forum. The Forum doesn't happen without your important contribution!

Please review the suggested topics of interest and the selection criteria prior to submitting an abstract.

<div class="well"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Acceptance of presentations will be limited with fewer speaker slots to fill this year.</div>

## Topics of Interest

 Individuals are invited to propose a GIS-themed presentation. However, special consideration will be given to abstracts relating to the following topics:

- Emerging GIS Technologies
- Cloud-based Solutions
- Mobile or Web GIS Advancements
- GIS in Social Media or Crowdsourcing
- Integrating Open Source tools into GIS Workflows
- New Techniques for Emergency Management
- Innovative Remote Sensing Techniques
- Working with Map Services
- Advancing access to Open Data

## Selection Criteria

The originality and the scope of the presentation should be of interest to a significant number of conference attendees. All abstracts must be non-commercial in nature - presentations that are heavily product specific or include sales references will not be considered.

Abstract selection is very competitive; please follow the format instructions outlined on the website to ensure that your abstract is considered. All abstracts will be reviewed for content relevance, originality and innovation.

## Submission

The deadline for abstracts is June 9, 2017.
