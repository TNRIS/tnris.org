            <p>The 2020 Census provides a new set of statistical geography for use with our American Community Survey (ACS). Because the ACS  5-year data are provided using a moving sample, it can be difficult to determine what vintage geography should be used with the data.</p>
            <h4 class="forum-2022-h4">Learning Objectives</h4>
            <p>In this workshop, we will explore ACS data and its application to both the 2010 and 2020 statistical geography and understand the vintages, differences, and relationship between the two.  We'll discuss ramifications of switching to the new geography for a multi-year analysis and how to accommodate the shift of census geography is a plus.</p>

Field workers will be able to collect data, mark up maps, capture location tracks, complete assignments, and navigate to assets all from one appl. This saves time for the field worker, because they will only have to download, sign in to, and work with one app - and it saves time for you, because you will only hve to configure maps for one application. </p>
            <h4 class="forum-2022-h4">Learning Objectives</h4>
            <p>In this session you will learn how to configure maps to support your field workflows, create your maps for offline use. Utilizing your own mobile device, you will test and deploy your map so it's ready for your mobile workers.</p>

            <p>Although we live in a digital age, sometimes we still need to print hard copy maps. For maps we take into the field smaller is often easier to handle.  However, the smaller the map, the harder it is to see the detail we may require. This is where map books come in handy. They allow us to print maps covering larger areas at our desired scale by breaking the area up into individual sheets which form the pages of the book. In ArcGIS Pro we call this functionalilty a Map Series.</p>
            <h4 class="forum-2022-h4">Learning Objectives</h4>
            <p>In this session we will explore the map series functionality in ArcGIS Pro.   We will learn what it is and how to configure it.  We will learn how index grid layers function and how to create them.  Next we will examine the use of Dynamic Text with a map series.  Lastly, we will examine how to print and export your series.</p>
            <h4 class="forum-2022-h4">Requirements</h4>
            <p>Students will bring their laptops with ArcGIS Pro (any license level) installed with a valid login.  This should be verified prior to the start of class.</p>

            <p>Through the use of extensions, advanced capabilities can be added to GIS software.  Third-party extensions such as the ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension bring additional functionality of products such as FME into your GIS.  This includes tools for spatial ETL, data validation, data export, workflow automation, and more.  Advantages include automation of workflows, documenting processes, sharing custom tools, saving time in getting the answer to the question, and integrating with a number of systems.  The use of an integrated spatial ETL allows for advanced workflows that go beyond the capabilities of built-in tools such as ModelBuilder.  Functionality includes: grabbing a zip file and extracting it, reading one of the files in the zip to set parameters, concluding if there is existing data, preparing each file set to be loaded into the existing geodatabase, assigning attribute values, calculating geometry, converting units, cleaning up the data, writing it out to the geodatabase, and looping through to relate the data together in relationship classes.  A wide range of options are available to GIS professionals seeking to automate common workflows in their daily lives.  This includes Modelbuilder, Python, and FME...among others.  Workflows where automation using FME is appropriate include when project data is acquired or stored in several various formats and locations.   Not only can FME automation help save time, but it can also ensure data quality through attribute and feature filters and comparisons.  What's nice is that FME can even download your project data directly from the source website, extract the ZIP file into your project folder, and visualize the features directly in the application.  All of this integration and automation leads to faster completion of the data collection and assimilation tasks of a GIS project.</p>
