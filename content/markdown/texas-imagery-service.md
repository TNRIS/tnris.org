### General FAQ

## How can the Texas Imagery Service help my organization?
The Texas Imagery Service serves statewide 6-inch, natural color imagery for use in mapping and computer-aided design (CAD) applications. It provides state organizations with a current and consistent imagery data source while offering the highest pixel resolution available for any statewide program through an OGC compliant Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and Web Map Service (WMS).

The Service provides significant cost savings by streaming quality imagery directly to your GIS or map application. There is no need to pay large storage costs associated with imagery files for serving terabytes of data.


-----

## How much does the Service cost for my agency?
The Texas Imagery Service is an annual subscription service paid in full for each year of participation. The service period runs from **September 1 to August 31** each year and can be prorated at any time.

Costs for the Service are distributed across state, regional, and local government. State agency cost is based on the amount of data usage in 'levels'. Regional and local agencies pay a flat rate.

&#42; State Agency cost is calculated based on an annual metric of service web requests. A web request is every **new** click, pan, scroll, load or zoom per user in your organization.

&#42;&#42; Cost does not include DIR Fee

-----

## Can I join at any time during the year?
Yes. For regional and local agencies, your annual rate will be prorated through August 31. For state agencies, your initial annual cost will begin at the lowest level, Minimum, and prorated through August 31.

-----

## Can I have access to just my city or county at a reduced rate?
All subscribers access all the same imagery statewide. Currently, there are no options for smaller areas at a reduced rate.

-----

## Can private companies on contract with a Texas government agency use the Service?
Yes, per the data use license, private contractors directly supporting work of a subscribing Texas government agency to the Texas Imagery Service may use the service. The subscribing Texas government agency will need to request separate links on your behalf.

-----

## What are the terms of use?
Coming soon

-----

## How is the Texas Imagery Service different from the State Programs currently in place to acquire imagery such as the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) or the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)?
The Texas Imagery Service is a mapping service that is available on-demand and with no data storage costs. It is licensed, hosted, and served by Hexagon. It offers 6-inch resolution imagery, which is four times higher resolution than the 0.5-meter Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) imagery and the 0.6-meter National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery.

The imagery represented in the Texas Imagery Service is not in the public domain and is restricted under license.


-----

## Will the state continue to pursue its own acquisition of statewide imagery such as the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) partnerships?

TNRIS will continue to work in coordination with partners to determine the need for orthoimagery outside of or in addition to the Texas Imagery Service by invoking TOP. This may include imagery acquisition at greater currency than Hexagon’s update cycle goals (targeted for a 3-year refresh cycle of the State) or during different seasonal time periods to accommodate leaf-off conditions. Additionally, at the federal level, we currently expect the statewide 0.6-meter 2 or 3-year NAIP updates, available to the public without restriction, to continue.

## The Service contains several layers. What are these layers? Which one(s) should I use?

<p><figure><img alt="A view of the layers in ArcMap" src="https://cdn.tnris.org/images/tislayers.png">
<figcaption>A view of the Texas Imagery Service layers.</figcaption>
</figure>There are several layers in the WMTS and WMS Texas Imagery Service. The ‘Texas’ main layer contains imagery from our legacy Google imagery flights last updated May 2020. The Hexagon layers may contain <b>more recent imagery in the rural areas only</b> compared to the ‘Texas’ main layer.  They are:
<br><br>
* <b>Texas_Hexagon_2018_15cm_Only</b> - urban areas 15cm/6in imagery<br>
* <b>Texas_Hexagon_Composite_2018</b> - statewide 30cm/1ft imagery<br><br>

**For urban areas, please continue to use the ‘Texas’ main layer** for the most recent imagery.
**Hexagon is currently flying the entire state of Texas at 15cm/6in resolution!** This 2020 imagery will replace the Google imagery statewide in the ‘Texas’ main layer in **early 2021**. The best part is that the switch will be transparent, and you will not need to reconnect or change your connection!
 </p>

### Layer Descriptions:

### Texas
Statewide mosaic of latest available imagery in the Texas Imagery Service from legacy Google imagery content. This layer will eventually contain the **new 2020 6-inch imagery flown statewide by Hexagon.** The ‘switch out’ from the Google imagery will occur in **early 2021**.

### Texas_Hexagon_2018_15cm_Only
This layer includes Texas’ major urban areas only flown by Hexagon in 2018 at 6-inch/15cm resolution.

### Texas_Hexagon_Composite_2018
This layer includes consistent, statewide imagery flown by Hexagon in 2018 at 1-foot/30cm resolution.

### texas-2011 through texas-2020
These layers contain imagery captured by Google from 2011 - 2020 that is now archived after new imagery became available. This layers each contain all imagery collected within each year.

### texas-basemap
This layer includes roads, county boundaries, major water features, and city names available as base information that were cartographically designed for use on top of imagery while using the service.

### Hurricane Harvey image layers
* corpuschristi_20170830<br>
* houston_20170831<br>
* la_lakecharles_tx_beaumont_20170902 and 03<br>

These layers include imagery flown over some of the affected areas during the Hurricane Harvey event. They include Corpus Christi flown on 8/30/2017, Houston flown on 8/31/2017, and Lake Charles/Beaumont flown on 9/2/2017 & 9/3/2017.
