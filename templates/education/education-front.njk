  {# temporary notice regarding upcoming online courses becoming available #}
  <p>
    Working from home is the new normal environment. To accommodate your training needs, TNRIS is changing the way training is delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
    In collaboration with our training partners the new schedule will include:
    <ul>
      <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Instructor-led remote classes to offer the same benefits of having your instructor in the session with you</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Self-paced online courses</li>
    </ul>
    The details are being finalized with intention to update the website soon. Thank you for your patience as we prepare the new version of TNRIS Training.
