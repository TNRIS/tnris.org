                                    <p>Austin Community College Incubator for Professional Skills (ACC Inc) developed and tested a three-component assessment of the accuracy of geospatial data in support of the Next Generation 9-1-1 Project of the Commission on State Emergency Communications, Texas. The staff of ACC Inc utilized ESRI’s ArcGIS 10.3, West’s MapSAG and Texas Google Imagery Service to analyze the address points, road centerlines and emergency service boundaries of two pilot counties in Texas for spatial accuracy, topological continuity, and geocoding logic. ACC Inc’s assessment represents a quantified determination of the initial quality of source data that are to underpin the Next Generation 9-1-1 Project. ACC Inc measured the positional accuracy of address points and road centerlines against corresponding photo-identifiable features in the high-accuracy, high-resolution Google Imagery Service and calculated horizontal spatial accuracy in accordance with the 1998 National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. In the validation of feature topology, ACC Inc applied a program of twenty-nine rules for topology, attribute consistency and relative location to the source data and cataloged the violations by rule. ACC Inc analyzed the geocoding logic of the source data with MapSAG and identified errors by type and quantity in the road-centerline and address-point data. ACC Inc’s methodology and results demonstrate an effective, data-driven process by which GIS data can be assessed for areas of enhancement to meet the requirements of an emergency routable database. Authors will present detailed metrics and statistics during their forum session for the assessments of the two pilot counties.</p>

                                    <p>As we build more emergency response infrastructure in Texas it is becoming apparent that GIS needs to play a major role in handling disaster mapping. Whether it be floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, or what have you one of the most important aspects of the disaster is answering the question "Where?". On top of that, GIS can add a new dimension to emergency response by being able to show graphically a variety of different data to perform predictive analysis and help with damage assessments. In this session you'll see examples of how Texas EGRT is filling this need and information on how GIS professionals can get involved with this volunteer group.</p>

                                    <p>Hybrid Remote Sensing is defined as taking a combination of remote sensing technologies to address a given application and provide a solution that better addresses a complete solution for the application. There are many applications that remote sensing is used for but by applying additional sensors to an application can provide a more thorough solution for this application. Examples of these types of project are positive train control, autonomous car mapping, airport mapping and Highway safety mapping. The presentation will cover the different remote sensing technologies to address these application and others. Additionally, the presentation will cover the methodology and constrains to apply multi-sensor technologies to a given project or application. Lastly, the data fusion of these remote sensing technologies will be discussed and examples will be provided.</p>

                                    <p>The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and OpenStreetMap.org (OSM) have joined forces to explore the potential for collaboration. The two organizations share a common mission to collect, map, and maintain roadway data. A small pilot project was developed to determine if further collaboration would be advantageous. The team is using OSM’s MapRoulette platform to crowdsource the digitization of polygons from more than 10,000 point features seeded by TxDOT and the Texas Historic Commission. The team hopes to demonstrate the great potential for this sort of collaboration through sharing resources toward a common goal, without which such an outcome would be unlikely.</p>

                                    <p>GeoNode (geonode.org) is a free and open web-based platform that facilitates the creation, sharing and collaborative use of geospatial data. As a platform for collaboration, A GeoNode application is community-driven and connect users around the world to shared GIS content. Designed to empower non-developers to create and share data online in a meaningful way, GeoNode lets GIS users build a story of interconnected geospatial data and non-spatial content: telling not just "what" but also "where".</p>
                                    <p>In this talk, our goal is to answer the questions "what is GeoNode, how can I make use of it, and why should I care?". As core developers on the GeoNode project, Sara and Dan will give a brief overview of the GeoNode platform aimed at a general audience of geospatial students and professionals. We'll then show live use cases demonstrating how users from different sectors (like education and humanitarian workers) are using GeoNode today. We'll also briefly discuss future plans for the platform from the GeoNode developer community, and respond to any questions the audience may have about this free tool for collaborative mapping.

                                <p>Traditional methods for conducting habitat assessments can be time consuming and can be constrained by geographical barriers. Using unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology may provide more accurate and cost effective alternatives to these methods. We have conducted several vegetation and waterbird habitat assessments with our minion unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and phantom 3 quadcopter. Using NIR, RGB, and thermal imagery from the minion UAV, we are able to classify vegetation over large areas. High resolution imagery from the quadcopter has been used to map vegetation in the San Marcos River. This has increased the accuracy of assessments, decreased post-processing time, and almost eliminated the need to map the area using GPS in the field.</p>
                                <p>In addition to vegetation monitoring, we are currently using UAV imagery to assess the feasibility of using UAS technology to monitor colonial waterbird nesting sites on the Texas coast. Traditional methods can be inaccurate and disturb sensitive nesting birds. Preliminary results have shown that imagery from the UAV can provide high accuracy and causes no disturbance. Preliminary results have shown that there is increased accuracy, less time in the field, and faster post-processing.</p>

                                <h4>Innovative University Administration GIS Applications: Texas Supreme Court Requests, On-line Class Assessments, Economic Reach, and Fundraising </h4></div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>The new GIS Center at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) recently started an initiative to assess how it can help support the specific mapping needs across the University Administration. Large public domain and regularly updated (by semester) university-wide data sets were found that had also been vetted with a focus on correcting addresses. This editing streamlined all follow-on geocoding application requests. As with all initial GIS projects, meetings were conducted to clearly understand the specific needs and mapping objectives of the end user (who had never applied GIS technologies). It was also particularly necessary to explain to the end user the intricacies of the mapping process and the many types of resulting map products that are possible.</p>
                                <p>The Office of University Advancement was the first to be visited. Their staff explained the need to initially generate maps of various distributions of SHSU’s 20,000 plus students by county in Texas by: 1) student count, 2) first generation students, and 3) alumni. They next requested a map of the distribution of all SHSU nursing students across Texas. This map was used in a formal financial support request to a foundation that solely funds nursing student initiatives. Word soon spread and the Office of Institutional Effectiveness, due to a formal request of the Texas Supreme Court, requested a set of maps and an associated databases that represented the number of SHSU students by Texas House of Representative District and Senate District. This same SHSU office, at the request of Blinn College (a collaborating student feeder school for SHSU), then requested a similar map of the distribution of Blinn students by Texas House and Senate district maps. The Finance and Operations Office next requested various maps that helped depict the “economic reach” of the University across Texas and the surrounding region. These resulting maps represented the cumulative salaries for SHSU employees (approximately 5,700 people) by county.</p>
                                <p>Additional Administration requests that focused on the Health Sciences included an initial map depicting the density of medical services around a potential site for the proposed new SHSU medical school. Due to a shortage of medical doctors, the SHSU School of Nursing was recently preparing a proposal request to the State of Texas to approve a new Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) Program and an Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nursing Program (AGACNP) at SHSU. The State requires that a new nursing program should not be located within 50 miles of an existing nursing program. The resulting map verified and depicted this appropriate distance and the map was included in the formal proposal to the State. Lastly, the University, through the Delta Center - SHSU On-Line, is also actively using GIS to assess the distribution, functionality, and associated marketing aspects of on-line classes by discipline. All of the above GIS applications occurred within the last year. In each of these examples, the results were quite enlightening, used to further the mission of the University, and each led to additional requests that are anticipated to be repeated many times for each office for years to come. In any organization, there are important GIS enabled mapping needs that are not yet being realized and that when implemented can make a significant difference. You only need to look around and you too can make a contribution with your GIS skills!</p>

                                <p>On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama signed an executive order, "Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information," promising government data access for everyone. The goal is "to ensure that data are released to the public in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable." However, there is still no "easy button" for finding, accessing or using U.S. government data. In this presentation, we will show some resources to locate government data, how to access the data, and what to do with the data once you have it to add value to your business.</p>

                                <p>The City of Cedar Park has experienced a large amount of growth over the past decade. The rapid expansion has left city departments in constant need of new and up to date spatial information. Map services can provide easy access to current GIS layers and enterprise database records for use in Public Safety, Public Works, Engineering, Planning, and other projects. The ease of publishing and customizing map services allows the data to be integrated within these departments and become part of the normal workflow. The services can be combined with field data collection to provide new and updated data for utility features, disaster management, and recreation. This presentation will highlight how Cedar Park has taken advantage of integrating data from GIS with Enterprise database applications, web applications, and field data collection to provide city employees with the up to date information they need to support our city and citizens in the best way possible.</p>

                                    In 2015 the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) contracted Woolpert to acquire over 7,500 square miles of orthoimagery. Each of the 78 regional stakeholders had their own unique area of interest (AOI). In the past, the delivery process was painfully slow and included burning data to CDs and hard drives for hand delivery or mail. Enter the cloud!! To make their lives easier, NCTCOG had the idea of streamlining the process within the Cloud and asked Woolpert to make it happen. Woolpert developed a new process, uploaded over 7TB of raster imagery to the cloud and sent out instructions to each stakeholder for download. Project participants were able to log into Woolpert’s cloud delivery system and download their specific data directly to their networks, saving NCTCOG hours of work and hassle. In this presentation we will discuss NCTCOG’s ongoing cooperative aerial project and past delivery hurdles, look at the cost-benefit of the cloud, discuss the good and bad of the inaugural attempt and put forward ideas for improving the process in the future.

She started to enjoy the complexity of urban landscapes in high school when she observed the city while riding the bus. She received a Bachelor of Architecture in September 2004, a Bachelor of Computer Science in September 2006, and a Master of Urban Design in November 2007 from the National University of Iran. She worked as an architect for urban projects at an international design firm between 2004 and 2007. She earned her Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Geography and Sociology from University of Missouri-Kansas City in 2013.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bagheri is interested in navigating disciplinary terrain in Geography, Urban Planning, and Social Anthropology to develop a working theoretical model to account for changes in the use and design of public space and the unique relationship between the aesthetics of modern planning, the gendering of spatial boundaries, and the contingent nature of public space in Middle Eastern contexts.</p>

                                <p>The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) is being developed to respond to growing needs for high-quality topographic data and for a wide range of other three-dimensional representations of the Nation's natural and constructed features. The primary goal of 3DEP is to systematically collect enhanced elevation data in the form of high-quality light detection and ranging (lidar) data over the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories, by the end of 2023. Benefits of such data apply to flood risk management, agriculture, water supply, infrastructure, management, and aviation safety. This presentation will describe lidar basics, show examples of lidar usage in various applications, discuss recommendations for the emerging lidar technologies of “Single Photon Counting” and “Geiger Mode”, and provide information on 3DEP program status and planning tools.</p>

                                <p>This presentation will focus on the role lidar has played in the development of local-resolution (i.e. parcel level) National Hydrography Data (NHD) within the states of Indiana and Mississippi. AECOM will provide an overview of the technical approach used in both states to identify and extract NHD hydrography features from hydro-corrected, lidar-based terrain sources. We will also talk about how other local datasets such as storm water pipes and dams have been incorporated into this local-resolution NHD. Additionally, we will discuss the relatively recent concept of ele-hydro and how that may promulgate the creation of local-resolution hydrography data in Texas.</p>

                                <p>It has become a common to hear about data “openness” and “access” when it comes to data (geospatial or otherwise), but these terms mostly refer to making more data more “available” in some form or another. This talk will look at Open Data from the perspectives of “validity”, “reliability” and “utility” over “quantity.” It will define and promote the ideas that are shaping the “next generation” of open data projects, tackling themes such as barriers to the use of open data among different communities, institutional commitments to sustaining quality open data, public-private partnerships, co-creation that results from open data and evidence-based decision making, and more. It is time to shift the Open Data discussion toward making direct and beneficial connections between shared data and the challenging problems and tangible opportunities facing municipal leaders, residents and businesses.

                                <p>The TPWD State Parks system offers over 9,000 publically reservable facilities; campsites, cabins, pavilions, etc. In early 2015 with the pending implementation of a new facility reservation system, the need to inventory amenities, collect measurements and photograph each reservable facility came to prominence. Existing TPWD databases were queried and park managers surveyed to build a starting point for populating an enterprise geodatabase. Once database preparation was complete, staff began field visits starting in June 2015 utilizing the combination of ArcGIS Online and Collector for ArcGIS. Due to the geographic size of Texas, the sporadic weather events occurring between 2015 and 2016, the large number of parks to visit (90+), and high park visitation, the logistics of this effort were easily overwhelming. As with any 'living' project, the data are only good when current, complete, and accurate. Once field data collection was complete, data maintenance applications were developed for field staff to contribute changes to the dataset as changes happen on the ground. Now that TPWD has all of this detailed information and documentation, it seems only obvious to make it available to all public visitors. A public web viewer will also be available showing all of the specifics of each facility, including photographs and attribute search functionality.

                                <h4>Golden-cheeked Warbler Habitat Change: Gains and Losses Through Time</h4></div>
                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>The golden-cheeked warbler (GCWA) was placed on the Federal Endangered species list by means of an emergency rule on May 4, 1990 due to significant population decline, reductions in overall range, and escalating loss of nesting habitat. Single point-in-time assessments of golden-cheeked warbler (GCWA) habitat are inadequate to determine if available GCWA habitat is declining, remaining stable, or increasing, a primary consideration for determining whether further protection is required or whether delisting is warranted. Studies that use consistent methodology to assess habitat change over several decades would be most informative. Previous research (Heger 2012) has determined that significant habitat loss was evident from 1994 to 2004. This current phase extends our earlier work through 2015.</p>
                                <p>We used remote sensing (ERDAS IMAGINE 2015) and ESRI ArcGIS ModelBuilder to identify and document change in GCWA habitat over three decades (1986 to 2015). Supervised classification of Landsat imagery was conducted and used in a mixed and evergreen habitat-based model to rank Central Texas GCWA habitat quality from low to high. We validated our model by comparing model predictions of habitat quality to that of actual GCWA sightings in Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (BCNWR). Our previous research (1986-2004) had shown that the greatest loss of GCWA habitat occurred along the San Antonio – Austin corridor just west of I-35, while the greatest gains were NW of Austin including the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (BCNWR). This phase of the study (2004-2015) indicates this trend is continuing. In addition, habitat loss seems to be accelerating in certain areas that were previously stable in 2004. A story map created in ArcGIS Online will demonstrate habitat change results and causes for these recent changes will be discussed.s</p>

                                <p>The State of Texas Advanced Resource Recovery program (STARR) at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) is dedicated to increasing severance tax income for the State of Texas, which has produced more oil and natural gas than any other state. This is accomplished by means of research projects that promote the drilling of profitable oil and gas wells by adding new or increasing existing production throughout the State of Texas. To date, the STARR program has completed or is currently working on more than 60 field studies and more than 15 regional studies. More than 50 Texas oil and gas operators have been, or are currently, involved in the STARR program over the project’s 22-year duration. We are developing a web-based, interactive mapping application that will provide information to STARR stakeholders on the special distribution of oil and gas production in Texas. The front-end of the web application integrates several free open-source and commercial closed-source software components to present data to the user. The user interface of the application is composed of a browser, which is supplied by the user, a series of open-source Javascript libraries, and several custom Javascripts that control integration of the disparate components. The web portal when completed will enable the general public to obtain a detailed understanding of STARR activities, the distribution of major active oil and gas plays in the State of Texas, and STARR’s impact on increasing oil and gas production in Texas.

                                <p>In order to mitigate flood hazards, decision-makers require a quantitative understanding of what happens to the rain after reaching the earth’s surface. Hydrologic models aim to answer this fundamental question by simulating rainfall-runoff processes over a watershed. The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) is a widely-used program for the assessment of watershed hydrology, and typical applications include urban drainage design, floodplain mapping, reservoir safety, land use studies, and flood forecasting. GIS processing tools may be used to analyze watershed characteristics, but the speed of model development is often limited by extensive data input requirements. HMS-PrePro is a new GIS tool that uses Python programming to extract geospatial information from Esri’s Living Atlas.</p>
                                <p>The extracted data is saved in a local geodatabase which is used to estimate hydrologic parameters and initialize a HEC-HMS basin model. Combining GIS with data services, a spatial database for a watershed of interest may be created expeditiously. HMS-PrePro is used to derive basin topology and estimate a number of hydrological parameters in a streamlined approach. The improved GIS technology provides much-needed operational links between raw hydrological data and end users. By using cloud-based GIS data,this tool may enhance efforts associated with flood modeling for decision-making purposes.</p>

                                <p>Managing water quality concerns within the State of Texas takes a watershed approach. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) divides many of the State’s water bodies into defined segments identifying individual rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs, which are in turn subdivided into assessment units (AUs). These AUs are represented as polylines and polygons in a regional geospatial dataset. The National Hydrography Dataset, specifically the NHDPlusV2, is a national geospatial dataset that includes representations of flowlines and catchments (small watersheds) that are readily available for use in watershed delineation. The Total Maximum Daily Load Program of TCEQ sought a semi-automated watershed delineation tool that produces a relational geodatabase linking each of several thousand AUs to unique watersheds, composed of catchments. Using Model Builder in ArcGIS, we created a tool and methodology that achieves this objective. Over the course of the project, the team met with a range of challenges, many relating to incongruences between the AU and flowline layers. This presentation will highlight some of the lessons learned as a result of integrating these quasi-similar datasets.
