                                    <p>As part of a larger program to facilitate geospatial research at the University of Texas at Austin, The University of Texas Libraries has been exploring a variety methods for publishing Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services to enhance discoverability of and open access to its collections.  This process of experimentation has yielded insights into service configuration and management that has allowed the Libraries to enhance its GeoBlacklight based data discovery portal and facilitate the development of custom web maps that incorporate its services.  The sheer number of geospatial datasets in the UT Libraries’ collections has made it critically import to develop a scalable system architecture and sustainable data maintenance workflows to facilitate the updating and publishing of map services.  To this end, the Libraries has designed its workflows to incorporate scripts for automating processes wherever practicable and has developed documented protocols to help guide designated users who have been assigned data management responsibilities.  This presentation will focus on the key lessons learned in the development of the UT Libraries’ GIS architecture, scripted workflows, and data management protocols.</p>

                                    <p>Our recent research progress on establishing a county-scale real-time flood response system is presented. This system is designed to provide instructive intelligence on flood impact to support flood emergency response. Streamflow forecast provided by the National Water Model is used to understand future flow condition. A terrain analysis workflow named GeoFlood has been developed to process the lidar-derived high-resolution terrain data, convert the flow conditions into corresponding flood maps and estimate the inundation risk of each building. Overlapping the inundation layer with the address point system gives decision makers and first responders insights to better organize the emergency response activities.</p>

                                    <p>The incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in civil engineering projects has dramatically increased, resulting in a significant change on the progress of the industry. Adoption of these tools has amplified the need for 3D elevation modeling using methods like Structure from Motion (SfM) to create dense 3D point clouds; However, considerable limitations continue to exist to this approach, such as the inability to accurately map steep vertical terrain or small above ground features accurately such as powerlines, roof edges, curb and gutter, and above ground piping. Another common solution has been to utilize Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, and although accurate this process can be cost prohibitive in many cases.   Through highly controlled testing and processing, we propose a third approach that integrates inexpensive UAS systems with stereographic compilation, a very old photogrammetric technique to extract 3D vector information with survey grade accuracy. Using both traditional photogrammetric workflows and principles, we are able to identify and correct variables affecting the error budget to consistently create an accurate mapping product faster than conventional survey at a cost-effective approach via drones.   This presentation will discuss that research and approach as well as demonstrate some real-world examples of using this technique and accuracies using the ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards.</p>

        <p> For centuries cartographers have been putting outdoor observations onto paper, and with GIS we moved to represent the real world as digital data objects. The real world is where the data resides, and at some point, we as humans need to interact with this real world to bring it into our GIS. From paper and clipboards to GPS, smartphones, wireless internet; we will discuss how field data collection has changed, where we are now, and what’s coming next.</p>

It also has an attribute display grid which sorts, filters, zooms to selected features, and exports data to CSV or shapefile. In other words, it does lot of the same things that a desktop GIS does, but inside the web browser. We will explain how we built these features with a combination ESRI JavaScript API widgets, custom python geoprocessing tools, SQL Spatial database scripts and secured ArcGIS server map services. And we will describe the steps we took to implement these features without sacrificing performance and remaining friendly to less experienced users.</p>

                                        <p><em>Aubrey Drescher</em> has an M.S. in Earth Systems Science from George Mason University. She fell in love with GIS in college and started her career as a GIS Analyst doing desktop GIS in private industry. Over time, the programming side of GIS began looking more and more interesting to her, so she took some night classes in .NET. She got her first developer job at a small company that builds web applications for the South Carolina Department of Transportation, and learned JavaScript on the job. About 4 years ago, she moved to Austin and into local government where she learned about python and map services. She currently works as a programmer in the IT department at the Texas Water Development Board and is active in the professional organizations around town, helping to plan each year’s ATX GIS Day.</p>
                                        <h4>Taylor Christian, TWDB</h4>
                                        <p><em>Taylor Christian</em> has an M.S. in Geography from Texas State University, and is working on her Ph.D. from there as well. Taylor has always been in love with geography, but fell for GIS while working at the Texas Water Development Board, and having to learn a lot of it on the fly. There was further opportunity to learn through classes provided by TNRIS, and ultimately ended up pursuing the Austin Community College GIS certificate program. Taylor’s career has focused on public service working at Texas State University, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and currently at the Texas Water Development board for the last 4 years. If you can’t find her at work or school, she is probably embroidering geologic sequences and topographic maps for fun.</p>

                                    <p> In 2016, the City of Georgetown undertook an effort to study the solar suitability of every rooftop within the City’s electric service territory. Using 2015 LiDAR data, the area, shading, aspect, and slope of each rooftop was assessed in ArcGIS Pro, allowing the City to provide the average solar potential to electric customers in an ArcGIS Online application. Uncovering this data enabled the electric department to apply for an innovation grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies to test a new concept – the virtual power plant. Georgetown is already using 100% renewable energy via wind and solar power contracts. However, by 2021 the peak electric demand will outpace supply. Current contracts have fixed prices for the next 20-25 years, but there are cost and reliability concerns due to long-distance transmission. The virtual power plant involves installing batteries and solar panels on homes within the city. Power would be produced locally on residential rooftops. Ultimately, the vision is an electric grid that improves service, reduces the impact of outages, provides protection against emergency weather and national security events, and keeps costs steady.</p>

                                    <p>It is vital to the operation of utility providers to know what assets they have, and where—especially if the lines are underground.  Across the industry, public and private utility providers are making a transition from static paper or CAD based maps to interactive and up-to-date GIS systems.  Technical journals are increasingly running articles singing the praises of GIS for delivering information to field crews and office-based decision makers, as well as tying into other business systems.  But where does the data, the “lines on the map,” come from?  All utilities must start somewhere.  This presentation reviews the City of Rosenberg’s 3 year-long program to map its existing water, drainage, and sewer infrastructure in GIS.  Although Rosenberg’s endeavor dealt specifically with utilities, the presentation will focus more generally on the following points: The benefits of deliberate, thoughtful, GIS project design.  Best practices in, and the practical reality of, data collection and mapping.  Finally, discussion of both general and utility-specific lessons learned from the project.</p>

                                    <p>Citizen science can be an effective and efficient method for collecting data, especially beneficial in monitoring species of concern such as endangered or invasive wildlife. The Texas A&amp;M Natural Resources Institute (NRI) has created smart phone apps using Survey123 from ESRI with public participation in-mind. These apps allow stakeholders to get involved in data collection by reporting species-specific sightings and other related information, which help inform important wildlife management and research projects at NRI. Our first app was created to allow locals in the Florida Keys to document sightings of the endangered Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) following Hurricane Irma, a Category 4 storm when the eye passed through the center of the Key deer’s range. This app enabled users to report real-time data on deer location, condition, and age, among other factors. Researchers can now use this data to better perform rapid population assessments and make immediate-response management recommendations to wildlife managers. The second app developed by NRI allows Texans to report wild pig (Sus scrofa) sightings and/or damage on private properties. As Texas is 95% privately owned, landowner involvement in wild pig data collection is vital. This data serves to better target extension outreach efforts to specific issues reported in affected counties.</p>

                                    <p>While necessity may be the mother of invention, scarcity is the more effective teacher. This presentation details how resource limitations, common in both private and public organizations, spurred the iterative development of an automated extract-transform-load process. As additional hurdles were encountered, the technical implementation swung from pure python to pure SQL and ended at a python-SQL mix that plays hard, fast, and breaks the rules for ArcSDE (10.3). The final script is deceptively short and belies the more transformational portion of this odyssey; the necessity of soft skills and coming to terms with not being the best at everything. This is the story of a database, an SDE, and a boy that tried to get them together.</p>

                <p>(1) TPWD offers a number of services to help private landowners achieve their land management goals. One of the most popular options is the Managed Lands Deer Program (MLDP), which in part provides landowners with a deer harvest recommendation created specifically for their property along with the state’s most flexible deer hunting season. In recent years, the success and growth of the MLD Program has challenged the department’s capacity to serve their customers. (2) Geospatial data and technology have allowed TPWD to scale up these services and engage with landowners and representatives more effectively and efficiently. (3) This project modernized a legacy application and workflow, allowing TPWD customers, managers, and scientists to share and interact with valuable spatially referenced data from any web-enabled, connected device in real-time.</p>

                <p>The Edwards Aquifer of Central Texas is home to eight threatened and endangered species that are susceptible to pressures from extreme drought, flooding, and population growth. The Edwards Aquifer Habitat Conservation Plan is a complex, multifaceted regional program that seeks to protect the vulnerable species of the aquifer to ensure their longevity during severe drought-of-record conditions. Since 2013, contractors have worked to restore and improve aquatic and terrestrial habitat in the Comal and San Marcos springs communities. Although the EAHCP annual report details the successes and challenges faced, there exists a need to reach a broader audience. ESRI’s Story Maps have proved a useful platform for documenting and sharing comprehensive habitat restoration information. The mobile-friendly, interactive features of this project help educate and increase awareness of past, present, and future restoration efforts for the endangered species of the Edwards Aquifer.</p>

                                    <p>We investigated historical trends of the extent and geographical distribution of sand shinnery oak prairies (SSOP) on the Southern High Plains in New Mexico and Texas by investigating historical geospatial datasets and semi-automated image classification of post-1975 Landsat imagery. Our objective was to create a baseline dataset on land cover change in the historical distribution of SSOP that facilitates future investigations into how vegetation heterogeneity could have shaped lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) habitat and population demography in the SSOP. We analyzed historical maps and documentation prior to the 1930s and remotely sensed data (aerial photography and satellite imagery) collected from 1930 to 2015. Land cover and land use maps from 19th and 20th centuries were digitized into a Geographic Information System. The presence of sand shinnery oak (Quercus harvardii), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) and grasses was identified through photo interpretation of canopy shape and texture information in 120 aerial photomosaics from 1930-1970 that were acquired for 22 sites within the study region. Distribution of the SSOP was analyzed using satellite imagery (Landsat time series) from 1975 to 2015. For New Mexico, results show that sand shinnery oak, sand sagebrush and grass associations have been reduced from an approximate potential extent of ~1,800,000 ha by the late19th century (mostly Lea, Eddy, Chaves and Roosevelt counties) to ~900,000 ha in 1977 and then to ~600,000 by 2015, with decreasing dominance of sand shinnery oak in the last 40 years. In Texas, sand shinnery oak prairies have been reduced to less than 25% of its historical potential extent (from 2,000,000 ha to 430,000 ha). We discuss methodological challenges in the mapping process and propose GIS-based methodologies to detect emerging trends in ecosystem loss based on time series of Landsat imagery.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The theme of this year’s GIS Forum can be interpreted as two antecedents (Grow, Innovate) and a consequence (Succeed).  Is our common GIS heritage a competitive advantage for achieving success as a profession, or are its idiosyncrasies constraining our fitness for adaptation?  Our talk will extend the notions explored last year about operant conditioning vs. causal knowledge stemming from the “Crow and the Pitcher” story; and share some thoughts on the competing criteria for progress if we are to successfully evolve.  Are we conditioned for success or failure in terms of our evolution as geospatial professionals, and what are the conscious choices we can make to adapt?  We will also suggest some unifying goals for our profession, and discuss the trajectory they could put us on.</p>

                                    <p>Data can be turned into information. Lidar point clouds will cover most of the state of Texas by 2019. Information like 2D building footprints, hights and roof-forms can be derived from the point cloud. ArcGIS Pro can take that information to create 3D buildings that can be spatially joined with zoning, use, appraissal information and others to be used in planning, emergency response and many other applications.</p>

                                    <p>ArcGIS Desktop was used to develop a spatial geometry model of the Edwards Aquifer (San Antonio segment), its overlying overburden, underlying confining unit, and outcropped basaltic intrusions.  The 3D model visualization was achieved in ArcScene.  An extensive Modelbuilder tool was created to make the processing of new data efficient and repeatable.  New processes for creating user-defined cross-sections have been created to provide further understanding of the underground structural details.</p>

                                    <p>1. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and a geographic information system (GIS) can be used by members of the public to manage the sustainability, resiliency, and environmental impact of their property while reducing cost of operation and/or increase profits with a Creative Shared Value™. 2. A history of fire suppression and overgrazing in Texas have caused conditions favorable for Ashe Juniper (Juniperus ashei) to convert grassland to woodland and dominate previously open areas, thus decreasing the foraging value of the land. Many central Texas landowners now clear Ashe Juniper to preserve valuable open areas. 3. Our process will use UAS to identify encroaching Ashe Juniper saplings and automatically mark a waypoint within a personal GIS to aid in sapling removal. The project will result in a tool available to interested individuals who seek to manage their land for an affordable price and develop a GIS that can be transferred to future owners of the property.</p>

                                    <p>UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems, commonly referred as drones) technology is widely used for high resolution image collection. After photogrammetry analysis, high resolution 3d model of the land surface can be created. Digital 3D model has its advantages and dis-advantages. For public demonstration and education purposes, physical 3D models can be used. This research has investigated UAS data collection, GIS model creation, 3D model conversion, 3D model slicing, and 3D printing technology. 3D printing of large scale and small scale land surfaces has been tested and 3D models of mountains, watershed, reservoir, and buildings have been printed.</p>
