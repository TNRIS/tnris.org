                                      Regional GIS data sets often lack, information about an area of interest below the county level.  This is especially true with oil and gas data.  How do you identify geographically which wells belong to an operator?  Information is available but it is time consuming searching through public data to find out oil field information.  Python can generate more meaningful information that can be displayed through GIS from public sources.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      The purpose of the python program is to take a shapefile of oil and gas wells for various counties in Texas and determine the boundary of oil and gas fields they reside in for each county.  Using search cursors determine the field name provided from the input shapefile.  A series of convex hull buffers will determine the boundary of each oil field.  According to the Texas Railroad Commission, in Texas wells must be a minimum of 467 feet from a lease line.  Between well spacing keeps wells a minimum of 1,200 feet from “any well completed in or drilling to the same field on the same lease or unit.” Statewide spacing is determined by these regulations and amended through the Texas Railroad Commission’s hearing process.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      With the boundary of the oil field determined, other information can be calculated like the fields area and oil well production figures.  This information can be used to determine how much severance tax an operator pays the state and the county where the oil field resides.  The State of Texas Advanced Resource Recovery program (STARR) at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) is dedicated to increasing severance tax income for the State of Texas.

                                      One of our primary responsibilities at TxDOT to maintain an accurate spatial inventory of roadway assets. We use a set of custom, Python-scripted add-ins developed for ArcMap to manage this process. They allow us to edit geometry, perform QA checks, and finally, to ETL the updates into an Oracle spatial database where assets can be edited.
                                    <p>
                                      Beginning in 2020, Esri will no longer support ArcMap version 10.3, moving instead towards ArcGIS Pro. This presented a major challenge to our workflow: ArcGIS Pro is built on the .NET framework, and customization is done using the C# programming language, not Python. We needed a way to migrate our existing toolbars from ArcMap to ArcGIS Pro; from Python to C#.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      This presentation will serve as how-to (and cautionary tale!) for users migrating custom-built tools from ArcMap to ArcGIS Pro. We will examine several different scenarios, the challenges we faced, and the solutions we arrived at. Specific Learning Objectives include:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Rewriting a Python tool in C# using the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET</li>
                                      <li>Calling a Python script or a Geoprocessing tool from C#</li>
                                      <li>Customizing the UI using WPF</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                      Anyone feeling a bit overwhelmed by the upcoming migration to ArcGIS Pro will find our story interesting, entertaining, and hopefully instructive. Come along and ride on the fan-tas-tic voyage!

                                      Advances in technology have created a fast-paced environment where accurate reporting is needed consistently and efficiently.  Bexar Appraisal District has an enterprise GIS system paired with their Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) system to accurately evaluate appraisal status.  Python Scripting and automated tasks allows for managers to make better decisions. I would like to show this with three learning objectives; how we query, compile, and analyze production data using python.

                                      In June 2019 the University of Texas Libraries completed development of the new Texas GeoData portal that it designed to enhance discoverability of the geospatial data contained in its diverse collections. The portal was developed using GeoBlacklight, an open-source software project that is gaining traction among academic libraries and which has been developed through multi-institutional collaboration. GeoBlacklight was determined to be the best solution data portal solution due in large part to its simple metadata schema and federated search capabilities enabled by integration of compatible metadata shared by other universities through the OpenGeoMetadata project.

                                    <p>
                                      This presentation will discuss the processes that the UT Libraries developed to aggregate, augment, and format metadata for the geospatial datasets shared in the Texas GeoData portal. Overall, this talk is designed to highlight the importance of developing accurate, descriptive, well-formatted metadata for geospatial datasets. It will detail how Python scripts can be used to automate metadata enhancement processes like gathering and consolidating information from multiple metadata sources, developing relevant keyword tags through spatial analysis, and exporting metadata files to multiple formats. Finally, it will illustrate how information found in the portal’s underlying metadata index can facilitate the discovery of geospatial datasets.

                                      Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) is a major component of atmospheric air pollution in cities worldwide. PM2.5 is highly variable in space and time and there has been an increased demand for accurate and reliable prediction of intra-urban PM2.5 gradient levels. The expanded use of low-cost sensors is recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency as the new paradigm for air quality monitoring. This study monitors and maps the dynamics of PM2.5 concentration at high spatio-temporal resolutions using the portable sensing techniques and explores the driving factors via a geospatial modeling approach. Specifically, mobile monitoring campaigns were carried out by bicyclists surrounding a university campus using a low-cost particle sensor and a GPS data logger. Geotagged 1-minute PM2.5 measurements were collected along a fixed route at 7 AM, 11 AM, 3 PM, and 7 PM every day over a two-week period. Spatial-temporal patterns of PM2.5 concentrations are quantified and the significance levels of within-day and inter-day differences are tested. We further identify the factors influencing PM2.5 dynamics, including meteorological factors, traffic, landscape horizontal compositions (e.g., the proportion of green spaces, building footprints) and vertical structure (e.g., average building and tree height) that are derived from Lidar and airborne optical images. A geospatial model is applied using the above predictor variables calculated within the directional wind sectors to incorporate the relative position of emission source and receptor. This integrated monitoring, mapping, and modeling framework and its findings can provide guidance for urban planning and health research.

                                      The federally endangered Houston Toad (Bufo (Anazyrus) houstonensis) is declining due to climatic changes, habitat loss or destruction, and anthropogenic habitat alteration. This species requires a specific breeding habitat of pine and oak woodlands and savannas, specific soil geology, and shallow or ephemeral ponds. The Landscape Ecology Program at Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) aims to support the conservation and restoration of B. houstonensis breeding habitat through the development of a high-resolution map of ephemeral and permanent wetlands using a series of GIS technologies. To map potential breeding habitat, available LiDAR within B. houstonensis’ geographic range was acquired. LiDAR was processed using Quick Terrain Modeler to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The DEM was then standardized in ERDAS Imagine, and the landscape sinks were identified using ArcGIS Hydrology Toolset. An object based image analysis was performed in eCognition to extract bodies of water over 400 m2 from satellite imagery to determine which landscape sinks contained water during wet years. The LiDAR derived sink datasets were then modeled with TPWD’s Ecological Mapping Systems, soil types, hydrological features, as well as pond edge slope to produce a final map of potential breeding habitat. Both information gaps and conservation actions identified in the Texas Conservation Action Plan will be addressed by this mapping project including: gaining information regarding ponds within this species historic range, assist biologists with the annual documentation of habitat, and locate potential areas where landowner incentives would enhance connectivity among sites.

            Today’s and tomorrow’s GIS leaders are being called upon to manage the complexity of rapidly expanding data volumes, with ever changing technologies, while meeting rising expectations about the availability and accessibility of location data. This presentation will extend the ideas Bill introduced in his “Carpe Geo & Parvus Momentum” keynote presentation at the 2018 Texas GIS Forum.  After a quick recap on the core ideas of “seizing the GIS opportunity”, this presentation will move on to describing overlay skills (above and beyond competencies in GIS, communication, coordination, and leadership) that create the conditions for success as an emerging GIS leader.  These points will be illustrated with stories and examples and will conclude with some thoughts on opportunities ready for today’s GIS leaders to seize.

                                      Debris management is one of many competing priorities that must be overseen following disaster events. While essential, the safe, proper and timely management of debris is often an overlooked component of emergency response. Disaster debris must be properly managed to protect human health, comply with regulations, conserve disposal capacity, reduce injuries, and minimize or prevent environmental impacts. This requires advanced planning and both pre- and post-disaster coordination between various levels of government as well as the private sector.

                                      The Disaster Debris Managment Tool (DDRT) was developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency to provide an interactive mapping platform that provides information and locations for facilities capable of managing disaster debris. The tool can be used by emergency planners at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels to effectively coordinate the proper recovery, recycling, and disposal of disaster debris in a way that complies with regulations, conserves disposal capacity, and minimizes long-term environmental impacts. The DDRT is currently expanding its coverage of states and territories to support multi-region sustainable disaster debris management. This presentation will introduce the expansion of the DDRT’s coverage into Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), the ways it can be used by emergency planners for effective debris management, and its broader scope in sustainable materials management and green remediation assistance.

                                      Public Safety agencies that respond to Emergencies on bodies of water need to know the best locations to launch their boats and know where hidden dangers are underwater. There are several jurisdictions around the country that respond to drownings and body recoveries. These incidents are intense and stressful. They are high profile incidents with news media coverage. Depending on local protocols these events can involve several agencies.

In 2018 we proposed a project for CSEC to provide a statewide set of match/control points to ensure that roadways snap or “shake” with each other at jurisdiction boundaries. This presentation will leverage the GIS analytical model to show how our project evolved through iterations and refinement of problem statements and data sets, development of analytic processes and workflows, and completion of the analysis and deliverables.</p>

                                      NoSQL graph-based databases are widely used in social media applications, such as Facebook and LinkedIn.  But they are underutilized in the GIS industry.  However, given their ability to model data as links and nodes (sound familiar?), they are actually a very good way to store and model geospatial data, and to represent complex spatial relationships.

                                    <p>
                                      In this presentation, we will discuss how a NoSQL graph-based database can simplify otherwise complex data modeling of real world features, such as transportation networks, by storing all of the information about intersections, or traffic circles, at the node level. We will provide an overview of how DDOT (District Department of Transportation, Washington DC) and the AppGeo team leveraged the existing DDOT Linear Referencing System (LRS) based on Esri’s Roads & Highways, to develop the workflow and processing scripts to migrate this data into a NoSQL graph database (ArangoDB), and discuss how the team developed web services, safety data visualizations, interactive queries, and a web application for viewing cross-sections.

          <p>Organizations are spending more time and money than ever on data, data science, and
analytics. There is no question that data platforms are increasingly powerful and are a key
ingredient to success. But organizations are making far more progress on the technological
front of data use than the human one. Organizations want to leverage their data to make better
decisions and improve outcomes, but in order to achieve this they also need to consider
organizational realities, which is where the complexities lie. In this talk we will discuss various
approaches and strategies for leveraging data (geospatial or otherwise) within your
organization.</p>

                                      The City of El Paso’s GIS team has developed a web based application that allows citizens to locate lost and found pets by using an interactive map.  This presentation will describe the use of data integration and how we are able to pull real time data from our animal services department’s pet search service in order to display lost pet locations on a map.  Previously, citizens were only able to browse through a gallery of pictures and descriptions of lost pets, whereas our solution empowers the public to conduct a location based search, thus making for a much efficient user experience.  This presentation will also illustrate the implementation of ESRI’s Story Map solution.  This solution not only enables us to show the locations of lost pets on an interactive map, but it also promotes an enriching user experience as it provides the means to display photographs of pets which are linked to geocoded points on the map. Our citizens will still be able to browse through photographs in hopes of finding their lost pets but also be able to click on a map to view a picture and description of the pet.  Finally, this presentation will also describe citizen engagement through the use of GIS, as citizens can also submit locations and pictures of their lost pets.  Future efforts will involve the ability to notify citizens interested in helping reunite lost pets with their owners by sending them notifications of animals lost in their neighborhoods so that they may be able to keep an eye out for and help search for these lost pets.

                                    <p>The City of Georgetown TX has implemented a new public water outage notification map. This presentation highlights how the city is able to leverage GIS technology to streamline workflows and increase public awareness during a water outage event. Two applications were developed from ArcGIS Online’s Web AppBuilder. The first allows field and control center staff to identify and isolate a water main break. The second displays an outage area to the public containing key information such as effected customers, crew status, and estimated time of restoration. The primary goal is to increase public awareness during an outage and leverage existing resources in the city. This was achieved using GIS technology.</p>

                                      Today's dynamic mapping environment finds users surrounded by volumes of highly accurate spatial data.  However most users and applications do not capitalize on the full 3D capability available today.  Basic change detection provides them with valuable insight but why limit the analysis to 2D viewing and interpretations alone?  Come learn about taking your GIS to the 3D level with fully interactive mesh of terrain and imagery to capitalize on data acquired for your next project and how to integrate with historical data already holding the 3D component.  Also learn about the various interfaces in which your 3D data can be utilized.

                                      Historically, the Texas General Land Office (GLO), Energy Resources division, has relied on aerial photography and visual interpretation to monitor and assess lessees’ operations of mine sites on Permanent School Fund (PSF) lands. These mine site operators pay royalties to the agency based on the amount of material mined and sold from the site, and the traditional audit approach provides no mechanism to accurately verify reported production figures. Since 2016, Energy Resources and the agency’s GIS team have been working on procedures to use fixed-wing aircraft or small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS, or drones) to acquire high-resolution aerial imagery and 3D elevation data to meet this audit need. This presentation describes this undertaking, what we have been able to accomplish, lessons learned, and the next step to take.

                                    <p>For years, TNRIS is known for collecting and disseminating Lidar data in Texas, a dataset that grows each year. TNRIS has implemented a streamlined, cost-effective, cloud-based repository for Lidar and all other datasets to be accessed directly by users through the TNRIS Data Hub. Adding value to these datasets, TNRIS uses classified Lidar to derive 2D building footprints, Digital Elevation Models, Digital Surface Models, and blocky 3D buildings. Beyond the constriction of defining the 3D buildings with a finite domain of roof forms (Flat, Gable, Hip, Dome, Mansard, etc), a more realistic, higher-resolution 3D building, is possible. Using the DEM, the 2D footprint, and the classified building lidar point cloud to create a collection of squares, rectangles, and triangles to graphically represent each building as a multipatch, while still having just one record in the table per building. 3D buildings can be then be used with other datasets to enrich them, such as address points, parcels, etc. 3D buildings can be then used for planning, disaster response, next-gen 911, etc. TNRIS is evaluating making both versions of 3D buildings available to the user.

                                      The Census Bureau has promoted a variety of geographic programs with local governments and planning agencies in preparation for the 2020 census.  The Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA), the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP), the Boundary Annexation Survey (BAS) and the New Construction Program are just a few of the geographic programs that support an accurate census.  In this session, we will summarize these programs, their results and the impact on an accurate count for the 2020 Census.

                                      San Antonio River Authority (SARA) has a Real Estate database and geodatabase for managing and tracking all property assets in their GIS system.  They have set up a mapping application for viewing property information and tracking and resolving data issues and discrepancies.   Together, SARA Real Estate and GIS staff and the AppGeo team have worked to assess current workflows and processes, and to identify potential areas of improvement for the management of SARA property data.   These improvements are related to data creation and maintenance workflows, data structure, technology platforms, QA/QC standards, and documentation. In this presentation, we will discuss the findings of this project, and present progress on the implementation of the various recommendations.

                                      Food safety is critical to the public and the government plays a major role in ensuring that. This research thus aimed at examining the spatial distribution and patterns of food establishment inspection scores in Austin, TX between 2016 and 2018. It also explored socio-economic factors that explained or accounted for the variability in the inspections scores. Some GIS techniques employed in the analysis included kernel density analysis, hot spot analysis, and Geographic Weighted Regression. Findings from the research showed that, restaurants with low scores clustered mostly in the downtown area. Again, population density and percentage of renters were among the significant factors that explained the variability in the inspection scores albeit with low impact.
