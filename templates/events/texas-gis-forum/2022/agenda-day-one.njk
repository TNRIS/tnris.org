        <p>
          Routing involves defining an optimal path in a real-world geographical space through user-defined points of interest subject to user-defined constraints. Although routing algorithms have been around for years, routing is typically implemented at the server level, which can result in significant costs and skilled labor requirements. We present here the development and implementation of a free and open-source software client-side routing library that minimizes these costs and labor requirements. We use a case study to show how to use the library in a demonstration web app. The library and demonstration web app are freely available on GitHub for commercial and noncommercial uses. Our goal was to build an affordable routing solution that would be efficient and useful to people who may have limited funds and development experience. In this presentation, we discuss the routing library functionality and associated algorithms implemented along with any limitations we discovered while using the library. We describe our public domain data sources and how to configure these and possibly other data sources for use in the routing library. Our case study web app is an historical walking tour of Castroville, Texas, that demonstrates one use of our routing library. This web app can help the community catalog historical properties for preservation and inspire tourists to come to Castroville and visit the historical sites. The demonstration web app also can serve as a starting point for other applications. We believe the routing library may be particularly beneficial to local governments and small nonprofits having limited funds for web app development. For example, a local public works department could use the library to build a web app for surveying field equipment. There may be many other applications, and we hope to inspire the audience to identify and discuss other possibilities with us.

          For 20 years, the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) has facilitated the purchase of spatial data for North Texas as a cost-sharing objective for local governments and other interested entities. The program, which began with orthophotography only, has grown to include numerous remote sensing products and derivative data. Most of the program’s growth has occurred over the last decade’s partnership with Woolpert.

        <p>
          The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) began a feasibility study in 2013 for improving travel in Caldwell County, Texas. The purpose of this high-level study was to ensure regional travel needs were met, and considered many factors including travel patterns, future growth and development, environmental constraints, and public input into potential improvement options. As part of the study, CAMPO partnered with BGE, Inc. to develop and investigate potential new roadway corridors within Caldwell County. Each of these potential corridors was subject to a complex and time-consuming suitability analysis that was originally planned to be executed manually by counting constraints such as homes impacted or streams crossed by each route. However, the design of the roadways was fluid, and any resulting changes to the road layout required another round of suitability analysis to be conducted. This left a finite number of iterations possible for the roadway design to meet the project timeline.

          Why can’t it be easier to share data? The basis of the conversation is understanding the user’s needs and the software they use.  How can we improve communication between GIS and CAD users to work more seamlessly and provide each other with valuable, useable datasets? Using examples of Autodesk Civil 3D and Esri ArcMap, how can workflows be applied when not using the most up-to-date software? What is on the horizon for newer versions of the software and what will we need to look out for to prepare for a shift in interoperability or lack thereof?

        <p>
          This presentation aims to show participants how FME can empower your GIS data through the use of traditional Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes and custom-tailored tools/applications. Examples of how NCT9-1-1 has used FME to transform, correct, and even enhance regional GIS data will be provided in this presentation. This presentation will focus on the impact that these transformative FME tools have had in the highly demanding environment that is 9-1-1/public safety, while also exploring other potential uses for GIS in general.

        <p>
          Building Spatial Data Infrastructures is no easy task. From the required collaboration to the workflow and everywhere in between there are evil monkeys, poppies and wicked witches along the way. Organizations must work with local data suppliers, other organizational departments, and even federal partners to support the data supply chain. If you are lucky, you can get the data suppliers to agree on a set of Data Governance standards to help ensure decent quality and data in a format that can be readily integrated. However, this is more often the exception rather than the rule. And often, the most daunting piece of the puzzle is getting all this incoming data to align as well as to keep it aligned as updates are supplied year by year. With pressure to do more with less, support staff to manage these efforts can be hindered by lack of resources to establish, as well as maintain, the implementation. In this presentation, 1Spatial will share the success in thwarting many of the "wicked witches” challenges through automation in support of all aspects of the Spatial Data Infrastructure workflow. This includes our Spatial Data Infrastructure implementation for the State of Michigan as well implementing data supply chains for Next Generation 911 for State of Georgia, Minnesota, Arizona, and LA County. We will show how these organizations are helping their partners to easily understand data requirements and are empowering them to correct issues by identifying where there are potential non-conformances in the data while providing valuable metrics on the overall health of the data over time. Lastly, once data meets an agreed upon threshold, the data is integrated with multiple sources of data into seamless organization-wide enterprise databases.  Put on your ruby red slippers and join us to learn about how to implement and enforce data quality to support data governance within your organization.

        <p>
          In 2019, the Texas legislature created a new state and regional flood planning process, with flood planning regions based on river basins. The initial regional flood planning groups were formed on October 1, 2020, with the goal of delivering the first regional flood plans by January 2023. The Texas Water Development Board needed to quickly provide the best possible representation of flood risk data statewide for use in upcoming flood planning efforts. Given the size of Texas, floodplain data can be disparate and exist in varying degrees of quality. There were quite a few challenges to overcome to provide a cohesive dataset in a rapid manner, while also maintaining quality. To assist in the development of regional flood plans, the Texas Water Development Board consolidated existing data sources to provide a composite flood risk dataset for the state of Texas. This presentation will describe the process used to consolidate various data sources and provide an easily digestible digitized floodplain dataset for Texas, in the form of a “flood quilt”.

          Following Winter Storm Uri, Sugar Land, Texas faced an unprecedented amount of green and bulk waste that required timely collection, hauling, and disposal. To supplement the debris contractor’s efforts in removing waste from 35,000 households, City Staff implemented a Debris Assessment Program, which utilized GIS tools for spatial data collection and representation. The debris survey was used to identify the type and estimated amount of waste throughout the City and fed into a dashboard that allowed City Staff to visualize the waste data. Using the spatial data, City Staff determined the collection capacity, developed recovery timelines, and allocated resources accordingly. This project assisted in minimizing expenses, improving the efficiency of collections, and providing a framework to expand to Rapid Damage Assessments that were then submitted to FEMA.

        <p>
          Accurate mapping of complex heterogeneous landscapes using high spatial resolution imagery is necessary for better land management decisions. However, large-area mapping at this resolution remains challenging due to radiometric differences between scenes, low spectral depth of imagery, landscape heterogeneity and computational limitations. Furthermore, in most land use land cover (LULC) studies, the spatial structure of supervised training data is largely ignored, which often inflates the model's accuracy. In this research, we used the training data on which spatial structures were accounted for to evaluate the effectiveness of spatial blocking in LULC mapping. Specifically, we aim to 1) evaluate the classification performance of two widely used machine learning algorithms (Support vector machine[SVM], and Random Forest [RF]) accounting spatial structure of data, 2) showcase spatial accounting structures of sample data reduces the over-optimistic performance of random cross-validation while improving location accuracy. We mosaiced National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) digital-ortho quadrangle quads (DOQQ: n = 137) over Kenedy County, downloaded LiDAR footprints (2199), and derived surface features. We employed multi-resolution image segmentation on NAIP and LiDAR surface features using eCognition software and several features at the object level. We used 3719 spatially independent sample points on eight identified classes. We found that an RF-produced thematic map had higher accuracy in a grass-dominated landscape than SVM. Although LiDAR information on NAIP improved performance metrics, we concluded that the information contribution of LiDAR over NAIP data was not practically significant in grass-dominated landscapes owing to the large computational cost associated with LiDAR data.

          Coordination between Primary Markets and GIS to leverage technology is an effective solution to alleviate cumbersome tasks, opening the way to efficiently winning jobs and performing at competitive rates. The Technology Solutions team at BGE Inc set out in early 2021 to work with the Ecology team to automate the process of generating Wetland Delineation Datasheets. Opposed to having this solution implemented to a single project, we treated the Ecology team as our client, creating a way for those capabilities to become standard business practice.
