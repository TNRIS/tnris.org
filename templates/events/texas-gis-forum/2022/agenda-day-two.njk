        <p>
          During an emergency event, data is critical for decision making. This presentation will review the methodology behind design a GIS based decision making tool followed by a product review of one such product. Utilizing common GIS products, the City of Sugar Land created a common operational picture which incorporated multiple data streams to organize, visualize, and store data before, during, and after incidents. Sugar Land’s Common Operation Picture (COP), gives Sugar Land employees the ability to access and visualize data spatially, allowing for decisions to be made more efficiently and effectively. The data feeds from multiple sources, including automated weather, traffic layers, reports from Field Staff, these combine to create situational awareness needed in the emergency operations center during an event. By employing this model, emergency management coordinators and GIS professionals could create a single source for emergency data utilizing ESRI products.

        <p>
          The Edwards Aquifer is the sole drinking water source for the San Antonio metropolitan area, and more than 2 million people.  It is also the source of water for irrigation in the 8 counties whose agriculture and industry it serves.  Irrigators depend on their permitted, allotted withdrawal from the aquifer to sustain their crops and Texas depends on them for food.  As the population increases, the demand increases.  However, only rainfall in the contributing and recharge zones increases the supply of water in the aquifer.  Any pollution entering the underground aquifer cannot be removed; it can only be avoided for a time at the estimated affected areas and flushed out eventually by enough rainfall.  Aquifer water is the natural resource whose wise management is in our hands to protect and enhance. To help prevent or reduce the discharge of hazardous and polluting materials in water runoff generated at fire incidents, the EAA collected infrastructure feature data and analyzed LIDAR data for 38 regulated facilities on the recharge zone in Texas. A GIS was built by georeferencing site maps submitted by facilities for registration of regulated substances and digitizing infrastructure data. Drainage patterns were confirmed or corrected using LIDAR and water accumulation was simulated to compare water levels at each site. Studying where water flows around features helped identify into which stormwater inlets, channels, or basins the water will drain. The data was published to AGO and field inspectors used Field Maps Mobile to do ground-truthing with disconnected editing. “Protective Areas” are the result of the final analysis, using a flowchart to determine where the water will go, where we want it to go instead, and where the firefighters should place protective boom to divert that water away from sensitive features and the aquifer (at each of the 38 sites). An app was built and delivered to the city for firefighters to access in their vehicles on the way to fires.

With opportunities for stormwater capture, groundwater recharge, and reuse projects, these public-access spaces also provide an excellent venue for low-cost, passive public education in the form of demonstration areas and interpretive signage. The multi-functional approach to flood control and stormwater management looks to create designs that serve more than one purpose. Low Impact Development and conservation technologies create room for redevelopment that often improves the condition and aesthetic of existing infrastructure.

        <p>
          Our work at AppGeo exposes us to a lot of the new ideas that are shaping the future of the geospatial discipline.  We also see how the needs of our clients across the US intersect these new ideas, so we have been able to see patterns and trends that matter for state and local government GIS practitioners.  This presentation will take you on a journey to explore these trends, highlighted with actual project examples from some of our recent work. This talk will not be focused on technology or the “nuts and bolts” of geospatial solutions, but rather a higher-level exploration of broad themes that include resiliency, equity, and safety that we are seeing on the rise and that you can expect to be dealing with in your future geospatial work.

          For decades, Sanborn has been in the forefront of data collection involving building information. Details specific to buildings are vital pieces of information related to both urban and rural populations and are fundamental to planning and policymaking. Critical infrastructures, such as public transport, electricity, water distribution networks, and emergency services, rely heavily on accurate building maps. It is a natural progression for our GIS data to evolve to a 3D representation. Esri’s newest software technology enable Digital Twin visualization-based GIS system integration. This presentation discusses the development of 3D models that are the genesis for creating a Digital Twin base map. Digital Twin models are paramount in building sustainable Smart Government and will become more and more relevant in our industry. This webinar will focus on the evolution of Building Information Modeling and will include a live demo within Esri software providing examples of Digital Twin base map products created by Sanborn.

        <p>
          Tabular join, spatial join, simple enough GIS operations when doing one to one. Things get a little more complicated when you have several polygons within the corresponding joining polygon, or one polygon spread into three or four. That is the case with buildings and parcels, now try that for 10M+ polygons and 253 appraisal districts! This presentation will talk about the problems encountered (so far) and how they can be solved. "Wise is the one who learns from another´s mistakes." and that is why you may attend this session, to learn from my mistakes!

          This presentation will discuss recent research into environmental factors associated with the presence of pathogenic organisms and vectors of infectious disease that have typically been thought to be restricted to specific tropical environments but are now emerging in new parts of the world. It will show how GIS software can be used for processing, analyzing, and mapping data pertaining to disease occurrence and environmental factors like climate and soil conditions to identify regions where diseases like melioidosis and Chagas may currently exist undetected or where they might be able to spread and become established in the future. A key focus of this research is to integrate various modeling approaches used to understand how climate-related events might influence the dissemination of pathogens and disease emergence. The automation of the research workflow through the use of Python will also be highlighted to demonstrate the benefits of using scripted processes to work with datasets like reports of disease occurrence that are regularly updated. Maps generated through this work, including maps of Texas, will be shared so that attendees have the opportunity to learn more about the local implications of changing environmental conditions and potential emergence of new diseases that have typically been confined to tropical locations. This work has benefited from and continues to be supported by the University of Texas at Austin Grand Challenge, Planet Texas 2050.

          The Geospatial team of the Texas General Land Office, in conjunction with experts from the Texas Colonial Waterbird Society (TCWS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS), Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program (CBBEP), Audubon Texas, the Harte Research Institute (HRI) at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, and others, has developed an updated rookeries polygon layer for Texas coastal zone. The layer incorporates bird sighting data derived from the TCWS annual census and previous rookeries mapping data by various entities spanning the last four decades. This layer delineates the land boundaries of colonial waterbird nesting sites or colonies based on the most recent aerial imagery and Lidar elevation contours. This updated rookeries dataset assists with the management of coastal leases on submerged state-owned land, oil spill response, coastal erosion, habitat protection and restoration, among other applications.

          Caves have traditionally been found in one of three ways: 1) following a lead given by a friend or acquaintance, 2) informally walking the woods looking for caves, or 3) conducting a formal, systematic karst walk to survey a specific area. This involves lining up every 15 meters and walking together to comb the area and make sure nothing is missed.  Formal karst walks can be very effective with good coordination and available manpower, but can require extensive hours in the field.

          The invention of radiocarbon dating fundamentally transformed how time was approached by archaeology. It has been argued that the adoption of geospatial technologies such as GIS, high-definition remote sensing, laser scanning has had equally significant consequences. This presentation explores the intended and unintended consequences of the geospatial revolution in archaeology.
