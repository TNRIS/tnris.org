          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri impacted all 254 counties in Texas. Numerous counties experienced record low temperatures and snowfall totals along with prolonged electrical power outages. Based on the concerns with the state's power grid, the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 3 to address weather preparedness for the state’s electrical supply chain in the event of energy emergencies. The bill provided the authorization to establish an electricity supply chain map produced by the Texas Electricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee. The legislation led the Railroad Commission of Texas to create a Critical Infrastructure Division to address administrative compliance and conduct inspections of the state’s natural gas infrastructure based on Texas Administrative Code Rule 3.65 and Rule 3.66. The division tracks and updates critical infrastructure changes for the electrical supply chain using GIS software. The division also uses geospatial data for data science analysis, tracking inspections through a digital Critical Infrastructure Inspection System (CIIS), and conducting vehicle fleet planning and operations. The division uses geospatial information to address various aspects of its regulatory responsibilities and requirements.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>

          <p>The FCC estimates that if we can reduce response times by 1 minute, that we can save 10,000 lives per year.  This session will discuss how ECCs can help to achieve this goal by leveraging the z-axis information from wireless carriers, along with indoor maps, to identify a true dispatchable location.   Many ECCs are receiving z-axis information from wireless carriers today in a Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) format which is unusable. Solutions are available today for ECCs to translate HAE to a true dispatchable location including the building name, street address, and floor, and when combined with indoor maps, the room where a wireless caller is located.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>In this session, attendees will learn how they can leverage the z-axis information being delivered by the wireless carriers, along with GIS derived indoor maps, to locate wireless 9-1-1 callers more quickly.</p>

          <p>The Projections and Socioeconomic Analysis (PSA) team of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) is responsible for developing annual and projected population estimates for Utility Water User Groups (WUG) in support of the Texas State Water Plan. The majority of WUGs are comprised of one or more Public Water Systems (PWS ). Following each decennial Census, PSA staff evaluate the relationship between Census block-level total population, group quarter population, and housing unit counts with current PWS boundaries, using GIS to calculate Census-based estimates for each PWS. Additionally, quality control measures are taken to address overcounts caused by areas where PWS boundaries overlap, and to account for rounding errors caused by obscure relationships between the census block and PWS boundary, or potentially incorrect boundaries . The presentation will cover how final estimates for each system are chosen based on a best fit model which incorporates the geographical minimum and maximum population, historical data, Census place data, and the Census-based estimate and how the final PWS estimates are aggregated by WUG and split by Regional Water Planning Area, County, and Major River Basin for further planning and analysis . Lastly, the presentation will also discuss assumptions and limitations of the methodology, and challenges of estimating population for each PWS.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>The audience will learn how to estimate the population of a specific area using Census Block data and population density. They will see how Census Blocks and PWS boundaries were overlayed and joined via Union in GIS, and how population was distributed to areas where PWS boundaries overlapped. They will receive an overview of Water Supply Planning programs. They will also learn how the Census-based population informs our WUG population, Gallon Per Capita Daily (GPCD), and municipal demand projections, which are a major component of the Texas State Water Plan.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to generate high-resolution and accurate 3D data. However, the true value of lidar lies not only in the raw point cloud data but also in the derived products and the democratization of this data. This presentation explores the various derivatives that can be obtained from lidar data, including digital elevation models, vegetation indices, building footprints, and more. These derivatives provide critical information for applications in disaster management, urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and environmental conservation. Moreover, the importance of data democratization, ensuring the accessibility and usability of lidar data, is highlighted. By making lidar data widely available to researchers, policymakers, and the public, data democratization fosters innovation, facilitates evidence-based decision-making, and empowers local communities to actively participate in resilience-building efforts. This presentation examines the challenges and benefits of data democratization and emphasizes the need for collaboration between data providers, governments, and stakeholders to create frameworks that promote open data access while addressing privacy and security concerns. Ultimately, the combination of Lidar derivatives and data democratization has the potential to revolutionize various fields, enabling more sustainable and resilient development.</p>

          <p>TxDOT is committed to roadway safety in the State of Texas.  The DriveTexas.org system publishes near-real-time roadway conditions and travel-related information to the Texas travelling public via an easy to use web interface, which is available on both mobile devices and desktop computers.  DriveTexas supports over 3 million user sessions per year. With the increase in roadway flooding events across the state, the need to publish timely flood hazards is more important than ever.  To answer this need, TxDOT, in partnership with the Texas Transportation Institiute (TTI), has incorporated a new "flooding likely" data layer into DriveTexas.  This new layer pulls information from flood control districts around the state and disseminates that information to the public.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>In this presentation, we will describe this success story of different agencies working together to get critical information out to the public in an easy to understand manner.</p>

          <p>Recently, a paper from Rosenberg et al. (2019) documented the loss of 3 billion birds in North America since the 1970s. Of those lost, 700 million are grassland birds, which includes species such as the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus; hereafter shrike). The regional statistics from eBird estimate that the state of Texas supports 6% of North America’s breeding shrikes and 22% of wintering shrikes, and it is identified by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Thus, it is critical to understand what drives declines in the state; for example, in the Oaks and Prairies Bird Conservation Region, which includes Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, Loggerhead Shrikes have declined by 94% since 1970 (Partners in Flight 2020). Currently, little is understood about what is driving shrike declines, and a coordinated effort is needed to evaluate nesting and productivity in order to allow comparisons across studies. In a suburb of Austin, Texas, partners have found a population of shrikes that consistently inhabit and breed within a public park subject to intensive human use year-round. As such, this location is not only ideal for collecting information about productivity to help close this information gap, but also presents an opportunity to involve community scientists and develop a monitoring program that can be integrated into larger-scale coordinated community science efforts. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department biologists and the Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture worked together to develop a protocol for nest monitoring and companion data collection apps using Esri’s ArcGIS Survey123 and Field Maps for local community scientists to monitor shrike nests. The community scientists needed a straightforward, simple, and easy-to-understand data collection tool to track nest status (via a “live” nest tracking map), to collect data on new nests, to monitor existing nests, and to determine the fate of a nest. Additional ArcGIS Survey123 forms were developed to track color-banded shrike sightings (including a dashboard to track sightings of individual birds) to facilitate territory mapping and seasonality of shrikes. Data collection began in 2021 and is on-going in 2023. We will share methodology and lessons learned from the development of the protocol and survey forms to help promote development of other coordinated efforts to involve community scientists in data collection for priority species and to provide inspiration for innovative ways to collect and track wildlife data.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>Community science can amplify the efforts of biologists, allowing for increased and consistent data collection. The audience will hear from the biologists on the importance of utilizing community scientists and mobile GIS applications (ESRI’s ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Field Maps, and ArcGIS Dashboards) for wildlife data collection. We will also share about lessons learned in the development of the protocols and data collection process to assist those who may be considering similar efforts.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>Though marine debris is a known danger to coastal ecosystems and wildlife, resolving the litter problem requires changing the attitude of the public and inspiring them to care for the environment. SPLASh (Stopping Plastic Pollution Along Shorelines- a litter cleanup group based in the Houston-Galveston region) is trying to connect people to wildlife via programming that specifically targets litter in bird habitats. Presenting scientific data in a friendly, engaging manner can be challenging, but the use of maps, landmarks and attention grabbing graphics help citizens recognize issues impacting their communities. SPLASh runs litter cleanups with the support of volunteers, collecting and documenting litter using a specific methodology (STOP), creating reliable and consistent data. This data is then added to the Texas Litter Database, a statewide repository of publicly available litter data; however, SPLASh required an online visual representation of their project progress, using metrics from their litter cleanups.  We imported cleanup data to design a versatile and flexible solution that combined ArcGIS Storymaps and Dashboards for their project.  These dashboards seamlessly import data directly from database downloads allowing the system to be easily used by non-GIS professionals, allowing SPLASh to maintain the system independently with little to no assistance.  In the future, we hope to see the use of these dashboards in direct coordination with cleanups - especially to show children just how much they can accomplish.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>Building a public-facing dashboard that can be managed by non-professionals can be cost effective for businesses. For non-profits especially, it may be the only way a dashboard can be maintained long term.  Building a dashboard that uses an existing database can be a challenge that requires flexibility, as well as frequent communication with the database manager.</p>
