          <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Geospatial Program (NGP) provides foundational digital geospatial data representing the topography, natural landscape, and manmade environment of the U.S. and is in the process of establishing the 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP) to modernize the mapping of the Nation’s inland waters. High-resolution, light detection and ranging (lidar) elevation data have been collected across much of the conterminous US (CONUS) through the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP). This data will be used as the source to derive a positionally accurate and detailed stream network. 3DHP is the first systematic remapping of the Nation’s hydrography since the original USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic mapping program that was active between 1947 and 1992.  By using modern acquisition, validation, and data management techniques, 3DHP will enable analysis and visualization for a broad range of environmental, climate, and infrastructure applications. This presentation will provide information on 3DHP, and on partnerships and data acquisition needed to support 3DHP.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>The urban forest is a key aspect of building climate resilience in major cities across the United States. Municipalities focus efforts on creating urban forest management plans that are, most commonly, centered around planting individual trees in mowed areas in public parks or planting strips. Though these measures are an essential component in increasing overall urban canopy cover, a singular focus on it overlooks the potential benefits of natural forested areas. Even small forested areas have much greater potential to reduce daytime temperatures and stormwater runoff, capture atmospheric carbon dioxide, and increase urban biodiversity as compared to traditional parks with large areas of mowed lawns. The Watershed Protection Department at the City of Austin realized the benefit of natural areas and established “Grow Zones” in riparian areas to improve water quality, reduce erosion, and promote biodiversity. However, these Grow zones should not be limited to riverbanks. Their outsized benefit to the urban environment presents a unique opportunity for cities to fight the effects of climate change. It is well-known that trees sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and cool their surroundings through evapotranspiration and by providing shade, but their ecological benefits reach far beyond temperature reduction. Dense vegetation with natural stands of trees and understory brush increase soil and vegetation health by allowing natural ecological processes and forest regeneration to take place. Along with reducing the amount of noise and air pollution associated with mowing, areas that are not subjected to regular compaction by heavy mowing equipment have less soil compaction, which increases nutrient and water infiltration and reduces erosion and stormwater runoff. This prevents flow channelization and allows enough time for soil and roots to absorb water and recharge groundwater reservoirs. Additionally, plant uptake of stormwater filters out harmful metals and chemicals, reducing the decline of water quality. The first step in forest regeneration is designating areas as no-mow zones to intentionally allow natural vegetation to grow. This project identifies COA-owned sites in Austin's eastern crescent that are well-suited for becoming natural forested areas. Ideal candidates for consideration are those that currently provide low ecological value to the surrounding community. A site suitability will consider: Tree Canopy Cover, Vegetation Health, Temperature, Soil attributes (ie. erosion and runoff characteristics), Proximity to the 100-year floodplain, Proximity to uphill parking lots</p>

          <p>The Landscape Ecology Program with Texas Parks and Wildlife has developed a workflow to extract canyons in the Balcones Escarpment using publicly available elevation data. The canyons were extracted for the purposes of updating the existing “Ecological Mapping Systems Data” and generating models to predict the locations of Bigtooth Maple communities for conservation actions. This appears to be the first large-scale spatial canyon data that exists for the state of Texas. High-resolution elevation data derived from airborne lidar were obtained from the TNRIS Data Hub for the study area. GIS software was used to generate landform features and create a series of models that capture features representing canyons meeting certain slope thresholds. The results of the models produced clearly defined canyons within the study area that can be used for the mapping and modeling efforts of the Landscape Ecology Program. Future work will continue expanding the study area and extracting canyons throughout the state. Additionally, modeling will be conducted to determine if the canyon features and abiotic data can help identify regions where Bigtooth Maple communities may exist.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>The terms metadata and fun are rarely found in the same sentence. However, metadata creation and procrastination often find kinship, at least in my experience of managing geospatial and supporting data. We can all relate to finding and downloading data that is an awesome fit for our needs, yet we soon discover it has scant metadata, or none. Who created it? When was the last update? What is its purpose, extent, or projection? While working with my team to develop a metadata specification, I began experimenting with Esri's Survey123 Connect as tool for metadata creation and collection. A robust metadata specification was needed to support disaster-related search and discovery mechanisms that we were building into a federated service-centric application. One of the big challenges in a large-scale application is enabling users to find what they need; a populated metadata catalog solves this problem. Survey123 Connect and a customized workflow has fulfilled many metadata objectives in our development project. Is this a novel use of Survey123 Connect? I am not sure, but maybe your organization has done something similar, or you are curious how we stitched this together.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>Survey123 Connect is a highly customizable collection form. Our goal is to describe several features we utilized in Survey123, such as coding for repeated n-number of entries (think data attribute fields), geospatial extent choices, attachments, controlled pick lists to enforce validation rules, UI autocomplete for huge lists, choice filters for cascading selects, and embedded JavaScript. We will also provide an overview of our overall workflow, to include how we process and curate metadata submissions, and where the metadata lives in our digital ecosystem.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>At the Texas Department of Transportation, roadway attributes are maintained conducted within the Geospatial Roadway Inventory Database (GRID) application either through manual updates in the user interface (UI) or an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. Roadway attribution is a crucial effort but time costly, especially when working with divided roadways. When a single roadway becomes divided, with a left and right roadbed separated by a physical median, the artificial centerline representing the route requires its own separate roadway attribution in addition to the left and right roadbeds. The attribution applied to the artificial centerline usually represents the right roadbed's attributes, though for some items it is the aggregation of both the right and left roadbeds’ data. Due to GRID’s limitation, a computed copy of attributes from one roadbed to another is not possible and instead requires manual input from a GRID user, which introduces room for error in addition to the time cost.  

The solution I will present is a tool I have created for GRID users which automates the creation of data for the artificial centerline. I have developed a python script that takes advantage of GRID’s existing ETL functionality to build the attribution using extracted right and left roadbed information. This tool is then integrated as a custom add-in tool within ArcGIS Pro to allow any GRID ETL user/editors to automate asset attribution of artificial centerlines for divided roadways.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>Audience will learn how TxDOT used Python and ArcGIS SDK for .Net to create a custom plugin in ArcGIS Pro to automate artificial centerline roadway attribution.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) developed the Texas Water Service Boundary Viewer (TWSBV), an online mapping tool to collect currently served retail water service area boundaries for approximately 4,500 public water suppliers in the state. Accurate service area boundaries play a vital role in the state’s water planning process. They are used to develop population and water demand estimates and other spatial analysis tasks that evaluate water supply and infrastructure needs. The TWSBV application was designed to have three versions with specific functions for editors, admin (TWDB staff reviewers), and the public. Each year as public water system (PWS) utilities submit their previous year’s water use data to the TWDB, an approved representative from the utility can log in as an editor and use the TWSBV application to review and adjust their system’s boundaries. The TWSBV administrator assists editors, reviews, and approves their submissions. For example, the editor version of the TWSBV application includes tools that identify boundary overlaps that can occur between neighboring water systems and helps editors and admins resolve those issues. In the public version, anyone can view and download system boundaries. The TWSBV application currently links PWS boundaries to other relevant water system data sources like the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Drinking Water Watch and historical water use survey data. In the future, the TWSBV application will provide additional PWS reports that will contain information such as water loss audits, conservation activities, recommended future water supply projects, water quality data, and serve as a gateway to comprehensive PWS information.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>During this presentation, the audience will hear background information on why there was a need for the TWSBV application. They will learn how PWS editors use the application to submit changes to their boundaries. The TWSBV administrator will demonstrate techniques used to review the submitted boundary changes using the application’s tools. They will be shown how any user can view and download PWS information including reports, boundary shapefiles, and maps through the application. They will also hear about plans for the application and its data.</p>

          <p>The concept of big data was popularized in the early 2000's by Doug Laney when he defined it by the three big V's, volume, velocity and variety of data. Trends in how we collect, analyze, and value data have been influence by this concept ever since. This focus on volume and velocity has created a landscape where metadata and data standards are often not considered. The principles of FAIR data management were introduced in 2016 with the intent to improve Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of scientific data resources. We will go over why you should consider FAIR data standards in your current work flows, and how metadata is actually not just a pain in the neck!</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>For many years FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) were created using manual GIS processes by many different PTS providers.  In January 2020 FEMA released an automated tool that generates FIRMs based on Geospatial database that was submitted with the Project Task.  Since AMP was released there has been a lot of questions on when it’s appropriate to use AMP over the Manual method, along with other technical questions-based symbology, labels, and Notes to User languages. This Presentation will cover a brief history of Flood Boundary Hazard Maps, Map Mod FIRMS, and Risk Map FIRMS and go into detail how to and how we can mitigate the obstacles that presented itself with the switch from manual production to Automated Map Production. The information that will be covered during this presentation will be valuable for individuals working on FEMA Physical Map Revisions and County Wide Flood Projects.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>By attending this session, the key takeaways for participants will be how FEMA FIRM production has evolved to be fully automated, and how we can mitigate the obstacles that presented itself with the switch from manual production.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>Loss of habitat and environmental changes have detrimentally affected many indigenous species of plants and animals around the world. Among the most adversely impacted have been birds. Especially hard hit are the colonial waterbirds along the coast that use decreased areas on beaches and islands as nesting habitat. Historically, locations of colonial waterbird nesting colonies have been surveyed using ground-based visual techniques, with results reported using point locations on paper maps and, later, GPS coordinates. Using point locations doesn’t allow for much change analysis beyond the increasing or decreasing of waterbird numbers from the annual surveys. More useful information could be gained with polygon outlines which can be used, for example, to document and monitor habitat changes due to shoreline erosion. The associated land ownership and bird species information can also help prioritize habitat protection and conservation efforts by governmental and non-government entities like Audubon Texas and the Texas General Land Office (GLO)’s Oil Spill Prevention and Response Program. In 2020, the GLO’s Geospatial team manually digitized more than six hundred polygons based on the most recent aerial imagery and Lidar data. Such manual drawing, however, is a tedious and time-consuming operation. We are evaluating new, faster processes to automatically generate polygons from images of various sources including satellite, drone, and Lidar data. We are also currently discussing a graduate student project with Rice University’s Data to Knowledge (D2K) Lab with the goal of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the mapping of shorelines and island boundaries from these sources.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>To learn how advancements in GIS technologies, including drone mapping and artificial intelligence, can be applied to the mapping of colonial waterbird habitat along the Texas coast through a collaboration between private citizens, university students, and governmental entities.</p>

          <h4 class="forum-h4">Overview:</h4>
          <p>A digital twin, or the detailed 3D rendering of a real-world study area, is often the goal when collecting and processing geospatial data. The rapid emergence and proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones for lidar or image collection continue to make the creation of digital twin models consisting of 3D data more accessible. Beginning with a camera-equipped UAV for data collection and GIS software for photogrammetric processing, GIS analysts can collect data and carry through the process to create a digital twin with image, point cloud, and mesh layers. From these derivatives of the geotagged UAV-captured images, further analysis can be executed with steps to generate terrain and surface models, extract key features, and overlay additional data for a more detailed 3D rendering of the intended area.</p>
          <h4 class="forum-h4">Learning Objectives:</h4>
          <p>1. Understand the data requirements for UAV-collected that will be used in a photogrammetric reconstruction.</p> 
          <p>2. Understand the value of photogrammetrically derived 3D data and how it can be classified and edited.</p> 
          <p>3. Understand how additional data layers can be created from the photogrammetrically derived 3D data.</p>
