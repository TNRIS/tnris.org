    <p class="lead">StratMap was originally established in 1997 by Senate Bill 1 to <strong>develop consistent statewide digital data layers</strong>. Since then, its primary goal has been to acquire and improve digital geographic data for statewide mapping applications.</p>
    <p class="lead">
      StratMap also maintains comprehensive data standard specifications to ensure consistent, high quality data products across the State. <strong>StratMap personnel at TNRIS</strong> work with multiple agencies on cost-share initiatives in order to provide the State of Texas with best value data products.
    </p>
    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <ul class="stratmap-work">
      <li><strong>The StratMap team communicates regularly</strong> with State, Federal, regional and local government entities to discuss mapping needs.</li>
      <li><strong>New projects are formed</strong> by identifying type of data required, location, specification, budget and timeline for delivery. </li>
      <li><strong>Data acquisition, production and independent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)</strong> are awarded to private geospatial contractors through the <a href="/stratmap/stratmap-contracts">Texas Strategic Mapping Contracts</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>After the final data deliverables are accepted</strong>, they are placed in the public domain for use by local, regional and federal government, academia, private industry and the public.</li>
